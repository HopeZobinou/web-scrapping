# Q1
Find 3 users who are closest to you in terms of age, gender, and occupation.  

For each of those 3 users:
* *A: What are their top 3 (favorite) films?*
* *B: What are their bottom 3 (least favorite) films?*

Based on the movie values in those 6 tables (3 users X (favorite + least favorite)), choose a user that you feel is most like you.  Feel free to note any outliers (e.g., "I mostly identify with user 123, except I did not like "Ghost" at all").  You can investigate more than just the top 3 and bottom 3 movies to find your best match.

This user is the *substitute you*.
