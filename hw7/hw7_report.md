# Q1
Find 3 users who are closest to you in terms of age, gender, and occupation.  

For each of those 3 users:
* *A: What are their top 3 (favorite) films?*
* *B: What are their bottom 3 (least favorite) films?*

Based on the movie values in those 6 tables (3 users X (favorite + least favorite)), choose a user that you feel is most like you.  Feel free to note any outliers (e.g., "I mostly identify with user 123, except I did not like "Ghost" at all").  You can investigate more than just the top 3 and bottom 3 movies to find your best match.

This user is the *substitute you*.  
## Answer

I am 21, male, and a student. The 3 users that are close to me based on age, gender, and occupation are "81|21|M|student|21218", "323|21|M|student|19149", "259|21|M|student|48823." 

||81's top 3|||
|---|---|---|---|
|**Movie**|
| Time to Kill, A (1996)|
| Schindler's List (1993)|
| Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)|

|| 81's bottom 3|||
|---|---|---|---|
|**Movie**|
| Very Brady Sequel, A (1996)|
| Father of the Bride Part II (1995)|
| Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)|

|| 323's top 3|||
|---|---|---|---|
|**Movie**|
| Godfather, The (1972)|
| Michael Collins (1996)|
| Braveheart (1995)|

|| 323's bottom 3|||
|---|---|---|---|
|**Movie**|
| Jungle2Jungle (1997)|
| Murder at 1600 (1997)|
| Money Talks (1997)|

|| 259's top 3|||
|---|---|---|---|
|**Movie**|
| Usual Suspects, The (1995)|
| Apocalypse Now (1979)|
| Titanic (1997)|

|| 259's bottom 3|||
|---|---|---|---|
|**Movie**|
| Mars Attacks! (1996)|
| Beautiful Girls (1996)|
| Full Monty, The (1997)|

I don't enjoy watching movies so I haven't a lot of movies. The only movies I recognize are Godfather and Braveheart. Those 2 movies are in 323's top 3 rated movies. I like those movies as well. I don't know the movies in his bottom 3. 323 is most like me.

Below are pictures of the process I took to get the user and the movie info.

## Discussion
I opened the user, data, and item files in Notepad++. In those files, I used "control f" to search for the users and their top/bottom-ranked movies.
