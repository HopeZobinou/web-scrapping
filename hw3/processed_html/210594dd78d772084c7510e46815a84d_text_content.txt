They were the first UX hire at a smaller company. They were trying to get the company to believe more in UX and hire more people. But the company was resistant since they weren’t sure of the value.They excitedly told me their proposed solution for this: “I’m going to tell the company about Design Thinking!”I said, “If the leaders Google design thinking, what will they find?”The look on their face said the answer.I continued, “You might believe that design thinking is another name for great User-Centered Design or Human-Centered Design. You come from a background where you probably did serious and thorough work. And maybe you called it design thinking. But what your leaders will find when they Google it will be out of your control. Then what will happen? Just tell them about UCD and HCD.”I also reminded them that their employer understood the value of UX enough to make their first hire. Remind the company of that. Because if the company hired this person but doesn’t understand or value UX, this person might want to start interviewing. And if they do understand it, they should see why they need more than one person struggling to do everything.They were grateful for the advice. And I wish them luck! But let’s discuss this a little more.Google “design thinking” and you will get lots of shapes! But what does it really mean? How do you do it well? And are you sure you want to throw that word around companies now, given rumors say that IDEO is going to redo it?Which definition is the dominant one?Every time we want to use a “hot” or trendy term, stop and have a critical thinking moment. Ask yourself, “If I use this term, and these people Google it, will they find information I’d be happy with? Or will I have to evangelize against what they read?”Design thinking is a great example. There appear to be 5,000 definitions of it, all fairly different, and all sure they are the one true way. You can read that design thinking is just another name for HCD, and we should be adhering to ISO standards around HCD when “doing design thinking.”You can read that design thinking is something everybody is already naturally doing, with no training or talent required. Just follow 5 easy steps, which can be done in hours, and brainstorm what you should offer to users. Research, evidence, and knowledge are optional. Rush out a guess and go for it.Being product-led is another example. You might hope that if you get your company to be more product-led, they will care about delivering quality and value to customers. But if you Google product-led, will you find true customer-centricity? Or will you find authors and trainers saying “customer-centricity” but teaching go fast, just guess, run with assumptions and hypotheses, and it’s probably “good enough” to get to the next step?Use terms that are more likely to be consistently and correctly defined.Talk about UCD and HCD instead of design thinking or being product-led. Be clear about the full process of Human-Centered Design.If you are trying to evangelize, fix process problems, or raise UX maturity, don’t accidentally (or on purpose) use terms that might muddy things or make the situation worse.And consider the unfortunate outcomes.The more we introduce terms and methods that teach teammates and leaders that anybody can “do the UX,” the less we should be surprised that we’re being laid off.When someone else at your company tries to introduce design thinking, stand up to it. You can say that it was trendy for a while, but it’s now controversial, and is likely to soon be replaced or redone. Tell them your company shouldn’t use any processes that don’t have a clear definition. They can Google “design thinking” and see hundreds of definitions.Point out how nearly none of these definitions or articles tell you what to do. You should just be empathizing, ideating, etc. How do we know when that’s been done well? What do we do if we’re not empathizing well or at all? Can we move forward if our “empathy” is based on guesses about customers or things we made up about them? That’s not empathy. That’s not even sympathy.Start disconnecting from design thinkingIt’s a great time to disconnect from design thinking. Proudly wave the flag of UCD and HCD. So many of you ask me how to do you stand out in today’s job market. This is one way. Move away from trends and buzzwords.Design thinking has been trendy long enough for us to know that while some people became excited about delivering higher quality for customers, it often worked against great products, services, and outcomes. We did something fast. We did it as a team, avoiding accountability. And we swept the outcomes under the rug, making it seem like it was always our plan to release something mediocre we’d have to fix later.It’s a great time to speak up against these things in your company. CX and UX are about advocating for customers and users. That means we can’t be quiet when authors, trainers, and others write or teach fake UX and fake customer-centricity. Be that advocate and say something.Bonus: the same goes for training and trainersI have seen companies in big trouble when they didn’t do enough checking on what a trainer would teach.Once upon a time, a UX department tried to grow, and tried to stop PMs from doing research. So they hired a name you’d know to train on Jobs To Be Done (I recommend task analysis over JTBD, but that’s another article). That trainer confidently told the audience of UX, PMs, and others that anybody can do UX research, and that research is really optional anyway. Evidently this author and trainer is OK with JTBD being based on guesses. Shame shame.This set UX maturity efforts back. The UX team freaked out and the PMs rejoiced that someone brought in as “the UX expert” was giving them a license to do whatever research they wanted, however they wanted to do it, or to skip it.Before you hire anybody to speak or train at your company, work with them to check their perspectives, slides, content, etc. You won’t want it to work against your internal efforts.Design ThinkingUser Centered DesignHuman Centered DesignUx StrategyUX----2FollowWritten by Debbie Levitt4.8K Followers·Editor for R Before D“The Mary Poppins of CX & UX.” CX and UX Strategist, Researcher, Architect, Speaker, Trainer.
