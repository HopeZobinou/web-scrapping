I watched so much TV I chose my confirmation name after the patron saint of TV.One day, I saw the Club Kids episode on Phil Donahue and I got inspired.Never mind I didn’t know what club they were talking about.I was a kid in Cleveland, looking for a club (with no idea about ’90s New York City).But, Halloween was coming. And, I wanted to be (my version) of a Club Kid.So, with a matted wig, sparkly tights, terry shorts, an army shirt, and a big mess of makeup I was a something.And, I didn’t give a flying fig what anyone thought of my something.So, this Halloween, perhaps you’re ready to find joy in being something, too.Forget the store-bought costumes and make your own underrated Halloween costume from your closet. Here are some ideas to get you started:EmployedThey say “dress for the job you want” if only one day a year. Might help you network, too.Santa ClauseGive your Santa suit another holiday of fun — because the world needs more good cheer.Home ChefDress as you would for making dinner. Don’t forget your apron and a big helping of braggadocio about your culinary experiments, preferably where no one got sick.CleanMatching socks, clean clothes, and a fresh haircut are a must for this pre-pandemic look.----1FollowWritten by L.B.
