Starbucks Japan releases limited-edition merchandise collection several times a year with seasonal themes including New Year, Cherry Blossoms and Christmas. The drinkware collections such as mugs, tumblers and stainless bottles with limited designs fascinate Starbucks fans across the world and they are highly popular items as souvenirs from Japan.
One of the most anticipated Starbucks Japan merchandise collections will be released in 2023 autumn, featuring the cute and spooky Halloween design. The Starbucks Japan Halloween Collection 2023 features the drinkware collection with limited designs featuring cats and ghost motif and dark-tone colours.
The collection will go on sale from 11 October 2023 at Starbucks stores in Japan and the Starbucks Japan official online store only for limited time while stocks last. Like other Starbucks Japan seasonal merchandise, the 2023 Halloween collection will be surely very popular and the items could be sold out quickly.
