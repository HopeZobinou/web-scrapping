Angry? Feel like the future isn’t clear? Or are you thriving? As for the job stuff, if you are hiring or know of people hiring, I’d love to talk. I can do whatever you need around sales and marketing, from working prospects to creating collateral to whatever else. Just email me back if you want to talk about any of that arc.As for the rest of it, if you feel similar, just let me know. I’m always curious how people are doing.ShareI’ve been trying to figure this one out for any number of years. I don’t have the complete answer, but I feel like I have some of the answer. Here goes:I’m infertile and cannot get my wife pregnant, which seems to be the only thing most women still want from a man. All around me, I see derpy-ass guys knock up their wives three times in five years, and then complain about having to make a PBJ sandwich. I feel like a complete and utter failure, and that I’ve failed as a dude. Anger.I drink too much periodically. That’s a depressant. It can spiral you into anger as well.I have no discernible professional arc anymore. I didn’t mind teaching (right out of college), and I loved ESPN for a while. Ever since then, I’ve been floating and meandering and generally useless. Currently I bartend, but next week I’m only assigned to one shift. I’ll make about $115 next week total.I’ve been writing for years and years, but I can’t seem to get much traction with it. No one really wants to pay me to write. I tried a Substack Writers and landed with a whopping four paid subscribers. I guess that’s more than zero.I don’t feel like I have many friends or close relationships. I felt like I had some, and they moved away from me emotionally — probably because I’m angry and depressed.I don’t think of myself as a good person.I don’t really know what to do anymore or where to start. Should I become an x-ray technician? Should I keep bartending? Should I join some type of men’s salon? I just feel so broken and angry constantly, and like I wish someone would Fucking care that I’m alive and trying.SubscribeDo you ever feel this way about yourself? Or the world in general?30Share this postWhy Am I So Sad And Angry So Often?whatisevenhappening.substack.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesOther8SharePreviousNext8 CommentsShare this discussionWhy Am I So Sad And Angry So Often?whatisevenhappening.substack.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesOtherdonna FitzgeraldOct 11Liked by Ted BauerSorry to hear about your current struggles. As you have most probably figured out you appear to be suffering from depression. Been there, done that. The only solution I found is to find something you want to do and start working on that. You are writing now, but I'm afraid it's just feeding your depression.  I loved your NO B/S style from years ago. Maybe switch to fiction? It might sound crazy but it's different and if it's the totally wrong thing to do, the universe usually steps in and offers a better alternative. I never comment on anything so please take this as a deeply felt vote of support for someone I respected, who is now having a hard time. Fundamentally, I'm sure you've got too much to offer the world for the universe to "throw you away." Hope you find something soon and I look forward to hearing what it is in your writing.

Is that overboard? I don't know, but I feel that way because you see things clearly and explain them clearly in a raw manner that, as Donna Fitzgerald said, is "NO B/S."As you've noted many times, mostly in connection with manhood but it certainly affects women as much, we connect money with personal value. If we can't make enough of it, we're worthless. Many would immediately reject the validity of that, but the rejection is based on the incorrect notion that money is somehow evil and a poor indicator of anything (with the possible exception of greed). While the worship of money has always been a problem, money itself is simply a method of exchanging value that's better than me going to the grocery store with 10 pairs of slippers I crocheted because I need a gallon of milk. Money is a stand-in for value. Not making money does say something about us........and I've been living in a hell of my own for the last 7 years because the work world and in particular the practice of recruiting is so terminally fouled up it's almost impossible for a straight shooting thinker with two active brain cells to get hired.I'm failing to provide for my family and it's because as HR consultant Cynthia Shapiro puts it, "The new hiring and interviewing practices have morphed into a barrage of trick questions, hidden discriminations, psychological traps, secret criteria, and unfair barriers that are actually designed to make you fall apart during the process." And does it result in better hires? No; the results recruiting is getting today are worse than 30 years ago.Most days it seems this world has no room for people. There's only room for the "brands" we're now all supposed to be. No wonder we're enraged most of the time.Expand full commentReplyShare1 reply by Ted Bauer6 more comments...TopNewCommunityNo postsReady for more?Subscribe© 2023 Ted BauerPrivacy ∙ Terms ∙ Collection notice Start WritingGet the appSubstack is the home for great writing
