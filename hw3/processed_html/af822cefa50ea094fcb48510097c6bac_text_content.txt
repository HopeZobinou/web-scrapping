WolfBiden speaks during a roundtable with Jewish community at the White House on Wednesday, October 11, 2023. Susan Walsh/APPresident Joe Biden’s promise for the US to “stand with Israel” continues a special relationship that dates back to 1948, when President Harry Truman became the first world leader to recognize the Jewish state, moments after its creation.There’s now a kibbutz named after Truman in Israel, and the US provides billions in military support to Israel each year.Israel has played an outsized role in US policy, and not just because most recent presidents have tried to play the role of peace maker between Israel and Palestinians and move toward a two-state solution.Three presidential historians provided context about the US and its relationship with Israel. Douglas Brinkley is CNN’s presidential historian and a professor at Rice University, Julian Zelizer is a CNN contributor and a professor at Princeton University and Mark Updegrove is president and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. Here's what they had to say about the US relationship with Israel.President Dwight Eisenhower became infuriated at Israel: Along with France and the United Kingdom, Israel attacked Egypt in 1956 in an attempt to seize the Suez Canal and overthrow Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Eisenhower pressured the countries to remove their troops — which they eventually did.President John F. Kennedy was concerned about Israel’s nuclear ambitions: Kennedy engaged in a quiet pressure campaign to let US inspectors into its nuclear sites and halt an Israeli nuclear program. Israel is thought to have developed nuclear weapons in the 1960s, although it has never formally acknowledged them.President Lyndon Johnson used the hotline to calm the Soviets during the Six-Day War: Johnson helped supply Israel in the years preceding the Six-Day War, in which Israel seized land from its neighbors. Egypt, as a result, closed the Suez Canal for years. Johnson agreed to sell some military equipment to the Israelis which was a shift in US policy at the time. “This was a very much a product of Cold War tension,” said Updegrove, the president and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. “I think there was a great concern that that would escalate beyond Israel, Egypt and Syria to being a much larger battle.”President Richard Nixon airlifted supplies to Israel and engaged in "shuttle diplomacy": Nixon ultimately supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War of 1973, a key moment that may have saved the country.“Most historians of that region think that the US munitions support was essential to Israel’s survival at that point,” Zelizer said.Henry Kissinger, Nixon’s secretary of state, also engaged in so-called “shuttle diplomacy,” engineering an end to the war and ultimately reopening the Suez Canal under President Gerald Ford.President Jimmy Carter brokered peace between Egypt and Israel: Carter brought Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat together for the Camp David Accords, which created a lasting peace between Israel and Egypt, its Arab neighbor to the South.Today, Israel enforces its borders on the Gaza Strip, but so does Egypt. That more than two million Palestinians live in the 140 square-mile strip without the ability to easily leave is why it is today frequently referred to as the biggest open-air prison on earth.

Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday.  “Reason dictates that they are underground,” Conricus said. “Reason also dictates that Hamas, since they planned to launch this attack and they planned to take these people hostage, reason dictates that they planned in advance locations to hide these hostages and keep them safe from Israeli intelligence, and efforts to get them out.” The situation with the hostages is an “extremely sensitive and complex topic,” Conricus said. Even though Israel has had “some experience” with hostage situations, they have never dealt with anything like this, he added.“Not in the scope, not in the magnitude and not in the complexity of where our hostages are, Conricus said.When asked whether an Israeli ground invasion was imminent, Conricus said he would not telegraph Israel’s schedule or intentions in this conflict. “It is clear and understandable that what needs to be done is that all of Hamas’ military capabilities need to be taken off the map. How that will happen, by what means, and what tactics, that is a few days in the future, maybe more than that.” Hamas fighters are holding as many as 150 people hostage in locations across Gaza following their raids on southern Israel on Saturday, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations said Monday.Abu Obaida, the spokesperson of Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, on Monday said Hamas would start executing civilian hostages if Israel targeted people in Gaza without warning.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link10:52 p.m. ET, October 11, 2023Wave of Israeli airstrikes have killed 51 and injured scores, Gaza health ministry says From CNN's Kareem El DamanhouryAn aerial view of buildings destroyed by Israeli airstrikes at the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza City on October 11, 2023. Yahya Hassouna/AFP/Getty ImagesIsraeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip have left at least 51 people dead and another 281 injured as of early Thursday local time, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The casualties were in the residential areas of Zeitoun, Sabra, Al-Nafaq, and Tel al-Hawa, it said.Some of the victims are still under the rubble, according to Deputy Health Minister Yousef Abu Al-Rish, who accused Israeli forces of intending "to cause as much damage and destruction, hence destroying entire residential areas.” Abu Al-Rish added that the death toll in Gaza is nearing 1,200 after the latest airstrikes. The minister described the situation as an “imminent humanitarian catastrophe” after Israel began a blockade of the densely populated enclave, cutting electricity, fuel, and water supplies. “More than 600,000 of Gaza’s population are deprived from water, and entire hospitals are deprived from water," he added, urging the world to stop the Israeli aggression. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioUSCrime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomPoliticsSCOTUSCongressFacts First2024 ElectionBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerOlympicsHockeyVideosLive TV CNN HeadlinesCNN MaxDigital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRAudioCNN UnderscoredElectronicsFashionBeautyHealth & FitnessHomeReviewsDealsMoneyGiftsTravelOutdoorsPetsCNN StoreCouponsWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoAbout CNNPhotosInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2023 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.
