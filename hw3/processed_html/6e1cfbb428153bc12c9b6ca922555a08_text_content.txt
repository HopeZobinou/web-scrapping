Vyapi Joins Leading Small Business Summit In Washington

On Thursday, October 19, Vyapi’s VP – Solutions, Robert Unterberger, attended the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s “America’s Top Small Business Summit: Ready, Set, Scale”, in Washington, D.C. The Chamber of Commerce, the world’s largest business association, brought together hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses from across the spectrum to connect with some of the country’s most successful large companies, including Google, Meta and Walmart. 

Vyapi, selected by the Chamber as a leading small business, participated in an exciting program filled with insights and tips for scaling operations, thinking outside the box, and growing the bottom line. That’s something we at Vyapi do every day for our small business customers.

Vyapi Celebrates National Boss's Day

Today, October 16, is National Boss’s Day. The owners and managers of small and medium-sized businesses should reflect on what motivates them, their hard work, their companies’ accomplishments, and the great employees who have made it possible.

On this Boss’s Day reward yourself for being on the clock 24/7. Buy that pricey cup of coffee. Have a spa day. Get away for the weekend. Sleep! All great ideas.

But we suggest on this Boss’s day, owners and managers should reward themselves with the right support to sustain and grow their businesses. Take a moment to consider how an awesome boss can overcome burdens like contracts by delegating them to a partner who can handle small business contracts professionally, affordably and quickly.

Taking control of your #contracts, as well as ordering pizza for your staff, is an inspiring reward for busy bosses.

Today's contract tip is about how to triage vendor contracts.

Working on vendor contracts can be overwhelming. We often have to use the vendor's templates, which adds a lot of time and energy trying to figure out the deal and the terms.

I accelerate my review by quickly assessing the risk before I start my review. Doing this helps me quickly identify the risk attributes, what terms I need to include, and how much time I should spend on this deal.

I ask these four questions:

1. Is it a direct or indirect purchase?

We use direct and indirect to classify what a company buys. With a direct purchase, you are incorporating the item into what you sell to others. With an indirect purchase, you are consuming or using it in your own operations.

The risk scenarios and potential liability of buying things for your staff to use are very different from buying them for resale to your customers.

2. Is it a good, service, or license?

Be very clear on what is included. If it is a service-only contract, many goods terms won't apply. And the terms are very different if only an intellectual property license is included.

3. Does it involve a critical function?

We need to take a lot more care if the contract relates to a critical function at the company. I'll invest a lot more time to work on a contract to purchase financial transactions software than the one for watering the office plants.

4. Does it create a meaningful risk of third-party claims or involve regulated or protected information?

These factors help you understand if it is a high or low-risk deal. If the deal doesn't have these elements or any other risk markers in this list, then I classify the deal as lower risk and not needing the same level of scrutiny.

What's your approach to triaging vendor contracts?

Here’s the deal. Contracts protect small business. By clearly defining legal obligations regarding sales, employees, consultants, confidentiality, equipment, real estate, and intellectual property, among other relationships, you’ll protect your company and hold all the high cards.

But crafting, negotiating, executing, renewing, and administering contracts can deal business owners a losing hand if they’re not prepared. One bad contract and all bets are off. Your company might even fold. So you owe it to your business to make sure your contracts are played just right.

Here are the most important small business contracts that you need. It’s a winning hand. There isn’t a wild card in the bunch.
