What do these audits mean?

          These audits are best practices established by Google to help build
          websites for optimal front-end performance.
        

          Each audit is assessed based on your adherence to them and ordered by
          the most likely impact to your page's performance.
        

          Note that Structure audits do not directly affect your Performance
          score, however addressing them can serve as good starting point to
          improve page load times overall. Additionally, some of the audits are
          correlated and thus, fixing one audit may affect others.
