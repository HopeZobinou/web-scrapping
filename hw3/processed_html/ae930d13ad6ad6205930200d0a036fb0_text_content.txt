So-called 'autumn colours' (yellow carotenes and red and pink anthocyanins) are present in their leaves all year round. We just don't see them because they're hidden by green chlorophyll. However, when day length starts to decrease in late summer, production of chlorophyll slows down and eventually stops. The green colour fades from the leaves, revealing glorious yellows, reds and pinks beneath.AdvertisementWhat's more, shortening day length also triggers the growth of corky cells across the base of leaf stalks, in preparation for leaf fall. This traps sugars in the leaf, which are converted to anthocyanins, giving the leaf additional red colouring.Most deciduous trees offer some autumn colour as the season changes, including trees for small gardens and even trees for pots, but some species and cultivars put on a particularly spectacular display.
