Key Takeaways

U.S. consumers anticipate inflation rising in the near and medium term, but falling in the longer term, a September survey by the New York Federal Reserve Bank found.The monthly study also showed participants felt college price growth would slow considerably, and gas, health care, and rent prices would drop.Consumers were more optimistic about stocks, as expectations that the market would be higher a year from now increased.



U.S. consumers expect inflation will increase in the near- and medium-term, but fall longer term, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.



The bank’s September Survey of Consumer Expectations showed the median one-year inflation outlook rose 0.1 percentage point to 3.7%, and for three years from now it was up 0.2 percentage point to 3.0%. However, looking out over five years, those surveyed indicated inflation would drop 0.2 percentage points to 2.8%.







Respondents anticipated the price of a college education would slow its growth rate to 5.8% from August's 8.2% jump. That was the biggest one-month decline since the survey began in 2013. They also suggested prices for gas, medical care, and rent would go down by 0.1, 0.4, and 0.1 percentage points, respectively. However, the price of food was expected to rise 0.3 percentage point.



Consumers indicated their expected earnings growth a year from now would be 0.1 percentage point higher at 3%, with the anticipated change most pronounced among those with college degrees. 



Increased borrowing costs impacted views on the ability to get a loan, with a greater share of households saying it is more difficult to obtain credit now than a year ago, while the share of those reporting it was easier to get credit dropped.



The average perceived probability that the stock market will be higher 12 months from now advanced 1.5 percentage points to 36.7%.
