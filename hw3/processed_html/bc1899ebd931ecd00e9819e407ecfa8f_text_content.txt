I'm switching to "eilmeldungen only". But I would like it if I could choose for which topics I would be notified, like I have seen in other European news apps.6 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoJulie Empainmore_vert Flag inappropriateJanuary 16, 2022Well, it's easy! It's at the moment one of the rare newspapers with a few critical, or neutral or investigative journalists and articles. That's their job, I am fed up with the conforming mainstream journalism . I wish it would be more.13 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSibylle Yaakovmore_vert Flag inappropriateOctober 19, 2022WELT provides an alround view on politics, economics and social news based on profound journalism. I like many authors with distinguished opinions and writing styles as they encourage to see things from another perspective, even it is only for a moment.3 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAxel Springer Deutschland GmbH | WELT DigitalOctober 21, 2022Liebe Frau Yaakov, herzlichen Dank für Ihre Rezension und Ihr Lob.
