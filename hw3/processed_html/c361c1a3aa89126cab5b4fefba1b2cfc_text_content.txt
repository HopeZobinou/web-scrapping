Rclone Automated Backups for WordPress
Automate WordPress backups to various cloud storage providers using rclone automation. Also supports restic for incremental backups using rclone.

Requirements

Sudo and SSH access to your server.
wp-cli installed.
rclone installed.

Optional

restic to add incremental backup support ( no setup or configuration needed ).

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up automated WordPress backups:
How to use:

Connect to your server via SSH: ssh root@server.ip.address
Download this repo zip file:

sudo curl -LJO https://github.com/bomsn/rclone-automated-backups-for-wordpress/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

Unzip the file

sudo unzip rclone-automated-backups-for-wordpress-master.zip

Delete the zip file

sudo rm rclone-automated-backups-for-wordpress-master.zip

rename and cd into the project folder

mv rclone-automated-backups-for-wordpress-master rclone-automated-backups-for-wordpress && cd rclone-automated-backups-for-wordpress

Run the initilization script

sudo bash config.sh
You'll have options to add domains and configure backups.
The script will guide you through the process, just make sure to add sites/domains and their correct path, add backup configurations such as backup time, frequency, retention period, and configure rclone remote(s), then create your backups.
Note: the domains and associated paths will be saved to definitions file, you can change it later if needed. However, note that changing the file doesn't change any running backups.
That's it, once you've completed all the configuration steps, a cron job will be created to take backups automatically using rclone. Feel free to use the menu again to make as many automated backups as you want.
Subsequent Use:
If you want to add more websites, create additional backups, disable or delete existing backups, or even restore the remote backups created by the script, just run the config script again sudo bash config.sh and use the available options.
