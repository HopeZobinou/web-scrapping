Why Would You Risk Buying Bitcoin Right Now? My Contrarian Take | by Alexandre Lores | Geek Culture | MediumMember-only storyWhy Would You Risk Buying Bitcoin Right Now? My Contrarian TakeAlexandre Lores·FollowPublished inGeek Culture·6 min read·Jul 16, 2022--6SharePhoto by Maurício MascaroBitcoin is a hot topic lately. It’s been in the news a lot, and not for good reasons. In fact, it’s currently down 72% from its all-time high of $69,000 in November.Investments that are more volatile are viewed by the general public as risky. Conventional wisdom tells us things like “the trend is your friend” and “don’t try to catch a falling knife”.

Historically, in the US, inflation has been around 3% annually. Over the past 12 months, it has been 9.1%. In emerging markets like Nigeria, South Africa, India and Brazil, inflation has been historically a lot higher.Over a 10–20 year time frame holding assets that return less than 3% annually is actually a far greater risk than volatility.In November 2013, bitcoin exploded over 550% in a single month from a little over $200 to $1,100.
