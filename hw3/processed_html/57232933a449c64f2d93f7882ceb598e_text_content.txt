Biden Says It’s Likely Americans Are Among Hostages Taken by Hamas 



 






President Joe Biden admitted on Monday that it is likely Americans are among scores of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas forces after they invaded the country over the weekend.
He also confirmed that at least 11 American citizens are among the hundreds of dead following the Hamas attacks.


“It’s heart-wrenching,” Biden said in a statement, according to ABC News. “These families have been torn apart by inexcusable hatred and violence.”
He also said that his administration is aware there are American citizens who are missing and that officials are working with Israel to discover more about where they could be. He didn’t elaborate on the number of Americans currently unaccounted for as the fighting continues following an Israeli declaration of war.
“The safety of American citizens — whether at home or abroad — is my top priority as President,” Biden said, according to the news outlet.
“While we are still working to confirm, we believe it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held by Hamas,” he continued. “I have directed my team to work with their Israeli counterparts on every aspect of the hostage crisis, including sharing intelligence and deploying experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts.”



Later in the evening on Monday, the White House said Biden would publicly address the situation on Tuesday around 1 p.m. EDT.
ABC News noted further:
Biden had no public events on Monday, drawing criticism from some Republicans, although the White House said he was meeting with members of his administration and speaking with close allies.
Earlier in the day, Rep. Kevin McCarthy held a press conference to propose a “five-point plan” for how the U.S. should respond — in which he said rescuing any American hostages should be the administration’s “first priority.”



“This administration must also make clear that harming any American will really result in the wrath of the United States,” McCarthy said. “We cannot repeat what happened in Afghanistan. It must be clear that we do not negotiate with terrorists and no American will be left behind.”
Since the unexpected attacks by Hamas on Saturday, Israel has reported over 900 fatalities and 2,500 injuries. Israeli Defense Forces had previously indicated that around 100 individuals were unaccounted for, and on Monday, Hamas issued a threat that they would begin killing hostages unless Israel ended its practice of shelling homes in Gaza without prior warning, ABC News noted further.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told ABC News the White House has yet to confirm that there are U.S. citizens among the hostages taken by Hamas. However, he said the administration has been in “constant touch” with Israeli officials over the previous few hours.
“We don’t really know whether they’re just missing somewhere, or are lost, or whether they’re being held hostage,” Kirby said of the Americans whose whereabouts are unknown. “I think we have to accept the possibility that at least some of them are being held hostage by Hamas.”
“We just don’t have good, solid answers right now,” he added.
Earlier during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Kirby became somewhat emotional when talking about images of women and children who were kidnapped.
“Sorry, excuse me, it’s very difficult to look at these images, Jake, and the human cost,” Kirby said after getting all choked up for several moments. “And these are human beings, they’re family members, they’re friends, they’re loved ones, cousins, brothers, sisters. Yeah, it’s difficult.”
ABC News added in a separate report: “Hamas fired thousands of rockets toward Israel and an estimated 1,000 fighters crossed into the country from the neighboring Gaza Strip. Israeli officials said at least 100 civilians and soldiers have been taken hostage.”
