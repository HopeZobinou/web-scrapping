Today, it’s the biggest Content Management System (CMS) on the market, and it’s not slowing down any time soon. It’s so huge it now powers 30% of websites on the internet. What makes WordPress so popular? The appeal lies in its key features: it’s free and open source. Because it’s so easy to use, edit, and redistribute, it’s the go-to choice of most new webmasters and business owners today.Because WordPress is open source, there’s an endless list of plugins that can be installed onto the platform to edit or add to the experience. From automated cloud backups to performance boosters, there are no limits to the WordPress platform.Because there are so many plugins to choose from, many new WordPress users find themselves confused at where to even begin. What plugins are worth the download and which should be left alone? This guide will cover the best plugins for optimising your WordPress website from start to finish in order to give your visitors the best experience resulting in making your business fly.Cloud HostingIf you want to succeed on the WordPress platform, you can’t store your website on the free platform at all. While WordPress.com has free hosting options, these come with strict limitations that will hold your website back. You’ll need to purchase a custom domain and host your website through a hosting service in order to have full control over your content.While you can choose a variety of hosting from shared hosting to a dedicated server, cloud hosting is one of the best options today. With cloud hosting, you rent computational resources on a pay-per-use basis. This means you don’t have to pay for more than you use, and there is a lot more flexibility. Here are the two most popular cloud hosting options for WordPress.Amazon Web ServicesWith Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can get your own virtual private server for as little as $3.50 a month depending on your needs. That’s quite the bargain for reliable, secure hosting. Through Amazon’s Lightsale, it only takes a few clicks to get your WordPress site up and running. Click here for a full list of AWS services at a glance.SitegroundAside from AWS, Siteground is one of the fastest growing cloud servers. It has the best level of service as any host, and it’s also the easiest to use with their one-click WordPress installer.Because it uses light-weight Linux containers, it’s excellent for saving space and boosting the overall performance of your WordPress website.Newt LabsOnce you’ve got an established site and business it makes sense to invest in fully managed cloud hosting, which is optimised for WordPress to provide your visitors with the best experience possible.
