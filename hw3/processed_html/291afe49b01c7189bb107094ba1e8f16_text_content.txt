The group has threatened to execute a captive each time Israeli airstrikes hit a home in Gaza without prior warning.Read More: What’s Next for Israel and Its DemocracyIsraeli airstrikes have razed whole districts and put Gaza, home to more than 2 million people, under siege. On Saturday, Gaza's health ministry said Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 2,000 people. According to the United Nations, more than one million people have been displaced in the Gaza Strip so far, with many taking refuge in shelters and schools or huddling in the streets. Israel has cut power and water to the coastal enclave until hostages are released. Clean water was running out on Saturday, leading to a “life and death” situation, the U.N. said. Fuel for hospital generators is also dwindling and internet and phone service cutting out, aid groups have reported. Israel ordered people in northern Gaza to evacuate south as it prepares for military operations, but the U.N. pushed back that the order would lead to devastating humanitarian consequences.Humanitarian aid groups operating in Gaza and neighboring Israeli towns say they are scrambling to assist civilians caught in the war from both sides. U.N. agencies have also appealed for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza, which had already been subject to a 16-year land, air, and sea blockade that left two-thirds of families depending on humanitarian aid.While showing support from afar can come in many different forms, below is a list of humanitarian aid organizations currently helping victims of war that are seeking donations.Kibbutz Nir OzResidents of the Kibbutz in Nir Oz in the Gaza Strip were attacked on Oct. 7, hiding in shelters as their houses and vehicles were burned down by Hamas militants with a standby squad standing in front of them until the army arrived at noon.
