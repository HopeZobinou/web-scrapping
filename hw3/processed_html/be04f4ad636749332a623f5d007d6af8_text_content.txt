The Facebook Pixel, when used with ClickFunnels or any other sales funnel software, becomes a powerful tool in optimizing your advertising campaigns.
If you’re looking to harness the power of Facebook advertising and track user interactions on your WordPress website, connecting Facebook Pixel is a crucial step. Facebook Pixel allows you to measure, optimize, and understand the actions people take on your site after viewing your Facebook ads. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of connecting Facebook Pixel to your WordPress website using the PixelYourSite plugin.
Step 1: Create Your Facebook Pixel
Before you can integrate Facebook Pixel with your WordPress site, you need to create a Facebook Pixel. Here’s how to do it:

Log into Facebook Business Manager.
Navigate to the Events Manager.
Click on the Connect Data Sources button and select Web.
Follow the on-screen instructions to create your Facebook Pixel.

Step 2: Install and Activate the PixelYourSite Plugin
The next step is to install and activate the PixelYourSite plugin on your WordPress website. Here’s how:

Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
Go to the Plugins section and click Add New.
In the search bar, type “PixelYourSite.”
Click Install Now and then Activate.

Step 3: Configure PixelYourSite Plugin
Once the plugin is activated, you need to configure it to connect your Facebook Pixel:

In the WordPress dashboard, go to PixelYourSite in the sidebar.
Click on Settings.
In the General Settings tab, paste your Facebook Pixel ID into the appropriate field.
Enable Automatic Advanced Matching for enhanced targeting.
Click Save Changes.

Step 4: Verify the Pixel Installation
To make sure that your Facebook Pixel is correctly installed and tracked, use the Facebook Pixel Helper Chrome extension. Here’s how:

Open your website in Chrome.
Click on the Facebook Pixel Helper icon in your browser’s toolbar.
You should see a popup displaying the events being tracked on your site.

Step 5: Custom Events and E-commerce Integration (Optional)
If you want to track specific events, such as purchases, add to cart, or page views, you can set up custom events within PixelYourSite:

In the PixelYourSite settings, navigate to the Custom Events tab.
Configure the events you want to track by specifying the parameters.
Save your changes.

If you run an e-commerce website using platforms like WooCommerce, PixelYourSite also offers e-commerce event tracking. Simply enable the option in the plugin settings.
Step 6: Publish and Monitor
With Facebook Pixel installed and configured, your website is now ready to measure and optimize your Facebook ad campaigns. As you run ads, you can monitor the data in Facebook Ads Manager to gain insights into your audience’s behavior and improve ad targeting.
That’s it! You’ve successfully connected Facebook Pixel to your WordPress website using the PixelYourSite plugin. Now you can leverage this powerful tool to better understand your site visitors and improve your Facebook advertising efforts.
