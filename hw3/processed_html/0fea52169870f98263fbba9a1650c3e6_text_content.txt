Los Angeles, California: In his monologue on the October 10 episode of ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’, the host took aim at some of former President Donald Trump’s attempts to denounce President Joe Biden at a New Hampshire rally on Monday, October 9.  .
Colbert commented on how Trump opened his campaign rally by calling the president a ‘crooked’ Joe Biden.

However, Trump didn’t stop there as he included another name in his rant to the crowd, referring to former President Barack Obama as Biden’s ‘boss’.
Trump’s comments on Biden and Obama raise eyebrows
Trump portrayed Obama as President Biden’s boss at an event in New Hampshire on Monday.  “You’ve been ripped off by everybody and betrayed by the corrupt globalists, Washington, Wall Street people, that combination of Washington, Wall Street, worst of all.  And it’s never been worse than it is now under crooked Joe Biden and, frankly, his boss, Barack Hussein Obama,” Trump said at the event.  “I think he’s his boss.”
“Really?”  Colbert asked on his show.

Trump was a major promoter of the debunked “birther” conspiracy theory, which falsely alleged that Obama was not born in the United States.
Colbert also mocked Trump for the “recycled” lines he used during the event.
The Internet agrees with Colbert
Stephen Colbert’s roast of Trump sparked backlash.
“You know, after all this time you’d think I wouldn’t be surprised by Trump’s bluster.  But it still leaves me wondering.  It’s like listening to a little kid tell a story that they make up as they say it.”  One wrote.
“Trump must be getting desperate if he’s trying to bring down Obama,” another commented.
“Trump still talks smack about Obama ROFL After all his troubles, he’s still going after former presidents,” said someone else.
“Just mind boggling how anyone can support Trump after listening to him speak for just one minute,” wrote another.
“Trump’s defense strategy is like the captain of the Titanic looking at an iceberg, and saying, “Full steam ahead!  This would make a great movie someday!”” one comment read.
