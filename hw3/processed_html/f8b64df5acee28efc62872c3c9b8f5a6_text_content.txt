Optimizing Images for WordPress: A Comprehensive Guide 


With mobile performance taking the spotlight in search engine algorithms, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure your WordPress pages are performing optimally. One primary factor affecting page speed is media, particularly images. This article sheds light on the importance and methods of optimizing images on your WordPress site.
Why Image Optimization is Crucial:
1. The Sheer Size of Original Photos: When you access a webpage, your browser retrieves numerous files. Among these, images usually consume the most data. An image captured with an iPhone X might be roughly 6 MB, while professional shots from a Canon D6 can exceed 20MB. In contrast, most full-width images on modern sites are just 0.15 MB, adequately serving the purpose.
2. WordPress and Themes Might Not Always Help: It‚Äôs a myth that WordPress and its themes always optimize your images. They might crop them, but compression is a different ball game. Moreover, popular page builder themes such as Divi may force you to use the original full-size image.
3. Plugin Limitations: Relying solely on plugins can be tricky. Leading image optimization plugins like Smush or Compress JPG & PNG Images have restrictions, especially in their free versions.
Perfecting Image Optimization for WordPress: To streamline your images for WordPress, follow this holistic four-step strategy:
Before Uploading:
1. Contextualize the Image Usage:

Consider the image‚Äôs placement.
Understand overlays and textures.
Identify if it‚Äôs a frequently used icon.
Be aware of automatic cropping by themes.
Plan for device variations, especially mobile.

2. Exporting for Web: Use platforms like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or other online tools to:

Crop based on Step 1.
Export with web optimization in mind. Use the following guidelines:

High-Quality, Large Images: JPG, 1920px wide at 60% quality.
Background Images: JPG, 1366px wide at 40% quality.
Standard Large Images: JPG, 1024px wide at 60% quality.
Medium-sized Images: JPG, 768px wide at 60% quality.
Icons: PNG, exact display size. Or use SVG for advanced users.



For PNGs, further optimization via TinyPNG can shrink file sizes significantly.
Post Uploading:
3. Plugin Enhancement: Despite their limitations, plugins like Smush and Compress JPG & PNG Images can further compress your images. They also handle optimization for automatically cropped images by WordPress.
4. Image Selection: Ensure you‚Äôre using the right image. When inserting images, especially using Gutenberg or the classic editor, always choose the correct image size. Avoid mistakenly inserting an improperly sized or cropped image.
Optimizing Previously Uploaded Images:
For those who‚Äôve been running a WordPress site for some time, there‚Äôs a likely concern: ‚ÄúWhat about the images I‚Äôve already uploaded?‚Äù Fortunately, your previous uploads are not set in stone and can be optimized even after they‚Äôve been added to your website.
1. Why Previous Images Matter: Retroactively optimizing old images is vital for several reasons. Older, unoptimized images can still eat up a significant portion of your page load time, especially if they are featured prominently on frequently visited pages or if your site has a vast image library. Optimizing these images can bring noticeable improvements to your website‚Äôs speed and performance.
2. Using Plugins like Imagify: There are several plugins available that can help you with retroactive image optimization, and one of the standout options is Imagify.

Ease of Use: Imagify is user-friendly and integrates seamlessly with WordPress. Once installed, you can bulk optimize all your previously uploaded images with just a few clicks.
Flexible Optimization Levels: Imagify offers three levels of optimization ‚Äì Normal, Aggressive, and Ultra. This lets you decide the balance between image quality and file size reduction.
Backup Features: Before any optimization, Imagify automatically stores a backup of your original images. This means you can revert to the original if you‚Äôre unsatisfied with the compressed version.
Beyond Images: Imagify also optimizes other media types, ensuring that all visual elements of your site are as streamlined as possible.
Compatibility with Other Plugins: Imagify works harmoniously with other plugins, including those that create different sized thumbnails or serve WebP images.

3. Other Tools and Plugins: While Imagify is a stellar option, there are other plugins like ShortPixel, WP Smush, and Optimal that offer similar functionalities. The best approach is to choose one that aligns with your site‚Äôs needs and your technical comfort level.
In essence, previously uploaded images don‚Äôt have to remain as they are. With tools like Imagify, you can improve your website‚Äôs performance without re-uploading or manually compressing each image. It‚Äôs a worthy investment for both site performance and user experience.
