Why Walmart is Really Closing Four Stores in Chicago: Black Communities Need to Stop Lying | by M. G. Fitzmaurice | MediumWhy Walmart is Really Closing Four Stores in Chicago: Black Communities Need to Stop LyingM. G. Fitzmaurice·Follow4 min read·Jun 30--ListenShareThe whining and wailing of communities in Chicago has not stopped. In a heart-warming demonstration, where citizens acted totally flabbergasted, they appealed to Walmart’s honour not to close those lifelines for their communities. Some speakers openly claimed that Walmart’s reasons for leaving were nothing more than company greed and racism. They held fiery speeches on crying elderly people, who do not know where to buy their medicine right now and about poor black families, not knowing where to shop for food now. Considering that there are eight Walmarts in Chicago, do you really think that a chain like Walmart is closing half of its stores purely on a whim? That they miss out on money because of racism? Sounds reasonable, I guess?Is Walmart a saint? Nope. Surely not. Walmart, however, put out an official statement that left no doubts why they left:The simplest explanation is that collectively our Chicago stores have not been profitable since we opened the first one nearly 17 years ago — these stores lose tens of millions of dollars a year, and their annual losses nearly doubled in just the last five years.No matter how well your business is running overall, you cannot gloss over losses endlessly. That is a sure recipe to get broke. This is a simple fact about businesses and too many people do not understand this.But there is a lot more to this story, and it is a wild one full of hypocrisy and hubris. Already in 2020, Walmart was about to draw out of Chicago, though stayed in the end. Two Supercenters, Store 5402 in Austin and Store 5781 in Chatham, were remodelled and reopened in 2020. Chatham now is one of the stores that is closing for good. The others are Little Village, Kenwood, and Lakeview.Walmart further states:The remaining four Chicago stores continue to face the same business difficulties, but we think this decision gives us the best chance to help keep them open and serving the community. […]. We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the city, including $70 million in the last couple years to upgrade our stores and build two new Walmart Health facilities and a Walmart Academy training center. […] It was hoped that these investments would help improve our stores’ performance. Unfortunately, these efforts have not materially improved the fundamental business challenges our stores are facing.The communities are not taking it well. They smell a conspiracy. A shopper stated:“Its like they’re trying to stop the black neighborhoods or something. I don’t know what’s going on, because, it’s always crowded. I mean, every time you come up here the lot is crowded, until it closes. I mean, so, how are you not making money?” (01:08–01:17)Another interviewed woman agreed that it was always busy “but they never have nothing” (1:30–1:32). A lady at the end of the video adds that before Walmart, a big Kmart was in there. But also left. Wonder why.Get the Scooby Gang, a mystery needs to be solved. Well, let’s think. Always crowded. Always empty. Walmart must make a s****load of money. But apparently, they are not. So, what happened?Robbery. Theft. Lootings.This was how one of their shops looked three years ago:Walmart stayed. However, the shops have been redesigned (if you scroll up again, one of the “improvements” they were talking about). You will find more and more products behind glass. This is a phenomenon all over the country actually. And it is not only annoying for customers, but held another chance for the company to commit a blunder. You decide to lock away those products, which are stolen most (one should think). However, it turns out that chains are simply openly racist. Walgreens, Target, Walmart (just to name a few) simply do not want black shoppers. Follow this logic, that black makeup is locked away because of racism, you also have to look at the rest. Condoms, gift cards, razor blades, food, hair colour — apparently, companies hate people who have sex, buy birthday gifts, have to eat; and they are also discriminating against old ladies, who are hiding their salt and pepper hair. Shame on them. Blatant misogynists, racists, and so on. (Where did I put my shame bell?)Whether they redesign the store aisles, put everything behind glass, move product sections — all those fancy “upgrades” cannot cover up the ugly truth, the pandemic of looting and the trail of destruction. Walmart announced months before their decision that these actions will have consequences for consumers — and rather sooner than later. They warned them. This was one of the stores last year:Like usual, people continued to play a stupid game and now they are shocked; have no idea what could have possibly happened. Except for racism, of course. The huge losers are all the poor, decent people, who do not feel entitled enough to steal. People, who also possess rudimentary knowledge of basic economics and a sense for their community.Black people need to stop lying. Otherwise, we will see many more stores closing with devastating effects on society, which will affect the poorest first. And you cannot count on BLM to help you out. If the stores close, they are doing so forever. And they will not come back. Not this time.Thanks a lot for reading.ChicagoWalmartBlackRacismLooting----FollowWritten by M. G.
