What is a WordPress Form Plugin?
A WordPress form plugin is a tool that allows users to create and manage forms on their WordPress websites without the need for coding or technical knowledge.

They enable website owners to collect information, feedback, inquiries, or user-generated content through online forms.
With a WordPress form plugin, users can create unlimited forms to suit their specific needs, including:

contact forms
registration forms
survey forms
order forms
newsletter sign-up forms

and more.
These plugins enhance the functionality and interactivity of a WordPress website, allowing website owners to gather data, communicate with visitors, and streamline various processes.
Numerous WordPress form plugins are available, each with its own features, pricing plans, and integration options. Users can choose the plugin that best suits their requirements and easily extend the capabilities of their WordPress website by incorporating dynamic and interactive forms.
Now, let’s dive into our list of the best contact form WordPress plugin on the market.
Best WordPress Form Plugins
1. WPForms

WPForms is the best WordPress form plugin and the best free form builder for WordPress.
WPForms is also the most popular WordPress form builder, with 5+ million active installations and 11,000+ 5-star reviews.

And WPForms comes with a readymade widget to quickly embed forms to pages, posts, and sidebars at the click of a button.
You can export your form entries in CSV and Excel files to easily manage your leads and subscribers offline or import your entire list on other apps.
The #1 goal of WPForms is to be user-friendly. It works with all popular WordPress themes and comes with powerful features and addons to extend its functionality to cater to all sites, including eCommerce.
A reliable customer support team backs WPForms with tons of documentation and step-by-step tutorials to help you make the most of the plugin.

2. Formidable Forms

Formidable Forms is a versatile drag-and-drop WordPress contact form builder with great performance options.
This WordPress form plugin can create complex forms like quizzes, surveys, payment forms, registration forms, profile forms, and much more.
Key Features and Benefits:

Cascading lookup fields to display available options based on the selection from the previous form field
Calculated form fields make it easy to provide online estimates, calculate product options, or show interest/repayment calculators

Formidable Forms form builder focuses on advanced users and developers, so it isn’t as intuitive as WPForms.
However, it’s the most extendable WordPress form builder solution. You can use it to create form-focused solutions like directories, job board listings, event calendars, management systems, star ratings and other rating systems, and more.
3. HubSpot
HubSpot for WordPress is a free all-in-one marketing plugin that includes a form builder, live chat, analytics, email, and more. So, it’s more than just a powerful form builder.
This plugin lets you easily connect the HubSpot CRM with WordPress to organize and segment your captured contacts into lists.
Key Features and Benefits:

Start from a template or build your design from scratch
Use up to 1000 fields & dozens of field types
Customize the styling of forms to match your website
Set up automatic emails and notifications based on form submissions
Integrate the HubSpot CRM to manage form submissions as contacts
800+ integrations available in HubSpot (including OptinMonster)

HubSpot is a great WordPress form plugin, but its value comes from its CRM functionality and numerous integrations.
4. Gravity Forms
Gravity Forms, a form builder for WordPress, is a visual form editor packed with features like multi-page forms, save and continue, and limited form entries. Its advanced features make it one of the best form builders for WordPress (specifically for developers).
Key Features and Benefits:

Visual form editor lets you build and design your WordPress forms in real-time
Use conditional logic to show or hide form fields, sections, pages, or the submit button based on user selections
Add file uploads fields to let users submit files or photos, avoiding back-and-forth to get needed files later
Allow users to save forms to continue at a later time
Create user-generated content with front-end forms that create WordPress posts

Gravity Forms doesn’t have a free WordPress form plugin, but if you’re going to be using it on multiple sites, cost shouldn’t be a factor.
5. Ninja Forms

Ninja Forms is a super basic WordPress form plugin that can be customized with the features you want with addons. The free contact form plugin is available in the WordPress plugin repository.
Key Features and Benefits:

Easy-to-use WordPress form builder with basic features
Tons of addons to customize how the plugin works, which lets you get only the features you need
Easily connects with services like Active Campaign, Campaign Monitor, Constant Contact and AWeber to keep you on top of your marketing workflows

While the core plugin is free, the pricing of just two extensions makes Ninja Forms comparable to WPForms or Formidable Forms.
6. Jetpack

Jetpack, developed by the team behind WordPress.com, is a well-known plugin suite for WordPress.
Key features and benefits:

Performance optimization, site management, and security modules, available in both free and premium versions
 Contact form module as a free tool
Create simple forms using both the Classic and block editors.

To add a form to the sidebar of your website, you need to create a form in a page or post, copy the generated code, and then insert that code into the Text widget. This process can be complex.
It’s important to note that Jetpack has some limitations. It lacks a visual form builder like Contact Form 7, and its functionality is somewhat restricted. Additionally, if Jetpack’s contact forms rely on Akismet for spam filtering, aggressive filtering can sometimes result in issues with email delivery.
7. Contact Form 7

Contact Form 7 is a free WordPress form builder.
Key Features and Benefits:

Create simple WordPress forms with checkboxes and dropdown menus
Build completely free WordPress contact forms
Integrates with anti-spam tools

Unlike other WordPress form plugins, Contact Form 7 lacks a visual form building interface.
8. Form Maker by 10Web

Form Maker by 10Web is a drag-and-drop form builder for WordPress with a user-friendly interface. The core plugin is free but limits you to seven different form fields.
Key Features and Benefits:

Unlimited field types make it easy to get exactly the data you need
Four display options (embedded, pop-up, scroll box, and top bar) to place the form where it works best for your WordPress website
Use the custom CSS editor to give additional styling features to WordPress forms and match them exactly to your brand
Register users on your website easily using the User Registration addon

Form Maker can be a bit much for beginners and those who need HTML and CSS skills. This WordPress form plugin might be better if you have some technical knowledge.
9. Visual Form Builder

Visual Form Builder is a drag-and-drop WordPress contact form builder.
It allows you to add form fields with a single click, then lets you drag and drop them to reorder them how you want.
Key Features and Benefits:

Automatic updates keep your forms running through each WordPress upgrade
Form submissions are saved in your WordPress database, which makes it easy to view, edit, export, search, or do anything else you need to do
Redirect to a WordPress page or URL after form submission to keep visitors engaged and on your site
Duplicate forms with one click to save time

Lastly, Visual Form Builder is also a free form builder, but the free version of the WordPress form plugin comes with limited fields, and you’ll need to upgrade for access to payment
10. UserFeedback

UserFeedback is a powerful WordPress plugin designed to help website owners and businesses gather feedback from their users. It allows users to submit feedback directly from your website without the need to navigate to a separate feedback form or email.
This plugin offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to provide feedback on various aspects of your website.
Once installed, you can create custom feedback forms and surveys and ask endless questions.
You can add it anywhere on your WordPress site, and it offers a range of customization options, such as star ratings, radio buttons, scales, email capture, and more.
Even better, UserFeedback offers a range of reporting and analysis tools, allowing you to view feedback trends and insights over time.
One of the key benefits of the UserFeedback plugin is that it allows you to gather feedback from your users without them needing to leave your website. This can help improve response rates, as users are more likely to provide feedback when it is convenient and easy.

OptinMonster’s Exit Intent® technology detects user behavior and prompts them with a targeted campaign at the precise moment they are about to leave.
You can unlock this powerful technology 100% free when you purchase our OptinMonster Pro plan.

Ninja Forms is awful. I’ve got two questions in a survey where the questions don’t show up on the front end, only the answer options. No obvious answers and no real support options. Avoid this clunker of a package.
