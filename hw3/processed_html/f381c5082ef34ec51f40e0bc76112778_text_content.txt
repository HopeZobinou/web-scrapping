Plugins are tools to expand WordPress site functionality. With plugins, you make your site dynamic. They are used for adding features to your site, enhancing user experience and overall site performance.
While the above is true, plugins can have varying safety and reliability issues crucial to your WordPress site. This is why testing plugins is essential to ascertain whether they are safe and fit for your website.
In this post, we’ll explore the safety of WordPress plugins and outline best practices for testing them effectively.
WordPress Security and Plugins
We can’t overemphasize the significance of security to plugins. In WordPress, security is protecting WordPress websites from various threats and vulnerabilities. If you want to protect your content and user’s data, security is key. It is even more important for WooCommerce stores.
WordPress plugins are a fundamental part of WordPress websites, hence the security needs. To reinforce this, check out one of our posts on WordPress plugin nuances.
Is it fine to Trust all plugins from WordPress Plugin Repo Blindly?
No. plugins in the WordPress plugin repos are a bunch of codes bundled together to make your website function the way you want it to. While the vast array of WordPress plugins provides numerous valuable tools and features to improve your website’s capabilities, it’s imperative to be careful when choosing and employing these plugins.
Are Third-Party WordPress Plugins Safe?
While plugins in the WordPress.org repo still go through code and quality checks, plugins on third-party sites can be considered ‘more unsafe.’
When considering WordPress plugins, it’s essential to consider their source. Third-party WordPress plugins are created to enhance the functionality of WordPress websites. These plugins are developed by independent developers and companies not affiliated with the creators of WordPress.
These third-party plugins are typically available through the non-official WordPress Plugin Repositories, other reputable marketplaces, and developer’s websites. Users can install them on their WordPress websites to tailor their sites to their specific needs.
The safety of third-party WordPress plugins can vary widely depending on the developer’s reputation, the quality of the code, and how actively the plugin is maintained. While many third-party plugins are safe and offer valuable features, it’s important to exercise caution when selecting and using them.
How to Ensure WordPress Site Security
WordPress is a versatile platform that empowers countless websites across the internet. While this flexibility allows for a wide range of functionalities, it also attracts the attention of those with malicious intent. 
To safeguard your WordPress site and protect your content and user data, prioritizing security is essential. Let’s explore practical steps to ensure the security of your WordPress website.
1. Choose Plugins Carefully
WordPress plugins are like tools in a toolbox, helping you customize your website. But not all tools are created equal. When selecting plugins, follow these guidelines:

Source Matters: Use plugins from trusted sources like the WordPress Plugin Repository or reputable third-party marketplaces. Plugins from these sources are more likely to undergo security reviews before being made available.


Check Popularity: Look at the number of installations. High usage indicates trustworthiness. Additionally, consider the number of websites currently using a plugin; it’s a reliable indicator of its credibility.


Frequent Updates:  Ensure that the plugins you choose receive regular updates. Developers often release updates to fix bugs and address security vulnerabilities. Neglecting updates can expose your site to security risks.


Compatibility: Check if the plugin is compatible with the latest WordPress version. An outdated plugin may compromise security and compatibility with your theme and other plugins.


Developer Reputation: Research the plugin developer or company. Reputable developers are more likely to prioritize security and provide user support.

2. Active Developer Support
A trustworthy plugin developer actively engages with users by responding to inquiries and addressing concerns. Developers who provide support are more likely to maintain their plugins properly. When issues arise, having a helpful developer can make a significant difference.
3. Regular Vulnerability Check
Don’t shy away from checking your plugins for known vulnerabilities. Tools like WPScan Vulnerability Database can help you scan your plugins for curated vulnerabilities. Staying informed about potential risks is a crucial part of site security.
4. Keep Everything Updated
Regularly update your WordPress core, themes, and plugins. Developers release updates to address bugs and security vulnerabilities. Think of these updates as essential maintenance tasks that ensure your site remains reliable, efficient, and secure.
5. Maintain Your WordPress Version
Running an outdated WordPress version can leave your site vulnerable to attacks. Make it a practice to keep your WordPress core up to date to benefit from the latest security patches and features.
6. User Authentication and Access Control
Use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts. Limit login attempts to prevent brute force attacks. Assign appropriate user roles and permissions to restrict access. Only grant administrative privileges to trusted users.
7. Backup Your Data
Regularly back up your website’s database and files. This is like having a safety net; it ensures you can recover your site in case of a security breach or data loss.
8. Secure Hosting Environment
Choose a reputable hosting provider that specializes in WordPress hosting. They often offer additional security features and ensure server software, PHP, and MySQL are up to date.
9. SSL Encryption
Enable SSL encryption to protect data transmitted between your server and visitors’ browsers. This is crucial for securing login credentials and user data.
10. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Implement 2FA for login authentication. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to enter a code from a secondary device or app.
11. Security Headers
Configure security headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. These headers add extra layers of protection to your site.
12. Regular Monitoring and Logging
Monitor your site for unusual activities and set up alerts for critical security events. Regularly review server logs and security logs to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
13. Educate Users
Educate users and administrators about best security practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts and avoiding suspicious downloads.
14. Incident Response Plan
Develop a plan for responding to security incidents. Knowing what to do in case of a breach can minimize damage and downtime.
15. Compliance
If your site handles sensitive data, ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.
By following these steps, you’ll significantly enhance the security of your WordPress website. Remember, security is an ongoing process, and staying vigilant is key to maintaining a safe online presence.
Plugin Testing in WordPress
The most effective scenario, where all the security measures mentioned above work optimally and are readily applicable, is when you thoroughly test your plugins in a controlled environment before deploying them on your live website.
In this pre-launch testing phase, often referred to as a staging or development environment, you can assess how plugins interact with your site without exposing it to potential risks.
Importance of Plugin Testing
Testing plugin installation in a staging environment builder tool like InstaWP before going live is the surest way to ensure WordPress website security. 
Let us look at some of the important factors that make plugin testing crucial for all. See what are its benefits:

Reduce Risk of Attacks: Although you may not be able to 100% prevent attacks on your website, you can significantly reduce them when you test your plugin safety in a staging environment like InstaWP. 


Resolve Performance Conflicts: Plugins can sometimes conflict with each other or your theme, causing unexpected problems. Testing enables you to identify and resolve these conflicts, ensuring that your website functions seamlessly before going live.


Guaranteed User Experience Flow: Ensuring a smooth and secure user experience is essential. The only way to guarantee this is by testing plugins beforehand allows you to fine-tune their settings and configurations, guaranteeing that your visitors encounter a reliable and enjoyable website.


Compliance Readiness: We mentioned previously how compliance is key in WordPress plugins vis a viz WordPress website security. Well, the best way to ensure that is through testing to make sure that your website meets security and compliance requirements from the outset. 


Data Protection: To users, there is nothing as important when they visit your site as their data and how it’s been handled. In a test environment, you can assess how plugins handle sensitive user data and content without exposing them to potential breaches. This safeguards user information and helps you maintain compliance with data protection regulations.


Performance Optimization: You can assess the impact of plugins on your site’s performance, such as page load times, and make necessary optimizations to enhance user experience and SEO rankings. InstaWP allows you to instantly create a staging site and install SEO plugins for testing.


Confidence Building: Staging site testing builds confidence in the reliability and security of your website. It provides an opportunity to address any issues and fine-tune your security measures before going live.


Time and Cost Savings: Discovering and fixing issues during the testing phase is typically more time and cost-effective than addressing them after your website is live. It helps prevent the need for emergency fixes and potential downtime. Align with the saying that “prevention is better than cure”.

InstaWP empowers you to identify and resolve potential issues, providing peace of mind and a solid foundation for a successful website launch. The benefits far outweigh the cost. You can learn more about the importance of using InstaWP to test your plugins here
