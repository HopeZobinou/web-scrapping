For several decades now there is one name that stands above the rest when it comes to action, adventure and dramas. And even after all those years he is still going strong. That man is the icon, Harrison Ford!He has been in such amazing films as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Blade Runner, The Fugitive, 42 and many, many more. In 1985 Ford starred in dramatic thriller entitled Witness. Now the good folks at Arrow Video are releasing this new classic on 4K Ultra HD and Blu-ray!When a young Amish boy inadvertently witnesses a brutal murder while en route to Philadelphia with his recently widowed mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis), Detective John Book (Harrison Ford) is assigned to the case. With the perpetrators desperate to silence the sole witness, Book and his two wards are forced to hide out in the heart of the Amish community. As passions between Book and Rachel ignite, the killers close in, culminating in a dramatic, life-and-death clash of cultures that will change the lives of those involved forever.Film fans are so used to seeing Harrison Ford as the anti-hero Han Solo, the snake hating archeologist Indiana Jones or the one the run Doctor Richard Kimble. But to see him living amongst the Amish, a bit strange. But he is amazing in this role. No wonder he earned a Academy Award nomination for his performance! And as good as he is the supporting cast is just as great!The story is so well written and the direction by Peter Weir (Dead Poet's Society, The Truman Show) is masterful! It really takes you right into the world of the Amish people for this exciting adventure. I have always enjoyed this film. But how would I like it in 4K?! Witness is presented in 4K 2160p) Ultra HD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible). The audio soundtrack options are for, the original lossless 2.0 stereo audio or the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. There are also English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing.Now I have this film on DVD and but to see it in 4K and HD on Blu-ray. It is simply amazing how much better the picture looks. The colors seem brighter and more vibrant and the picture is crisp and clean. The audio is clear. It is a gorgeous upgrade for this film! But as we know Arrow Video doesn't end things with a beautiful looking film. They add tons of bonus features and this release is no different!* Brand new audio commentary by film historian Jarret Gahan* Brand new video interview with cinematographer John Seale* Brand new visual essay on the film’s performances by film journalist Staci Layne Wilson* Vintage 1985 interview in which Harrison Ford discusses Witness with critic Bobbie Wygant* Between Two Worlds – five-part archival documentary on the making of the film, featuring interviews with Harrison Ford, Kelly McGillis, Peter Weir, John Seale, producer Edward S. Feldman, and actors Lukas Haas, Patti LuPone and Viggo Mortensen* A Conversation with Peter Weir – archival interview with the film’s director* Two vintage EPK featurettes* Deleted scene from the network TV version of the film* Theatrical trailer* Image gallery* Limited edition packaging with reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tommy Pocket* Limited edition 60-page perfect bound booklet illustrated by Tommy Pocket, featuring new writing on the film by Dennis Capicik, Martyn Conterio, John Harrison and Amanda Reyes* Fold-out double-sided poster featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tommy Pocket* Six double-sided collector’s postcardsArrow Video has done it yet again! They have made another release that I can't help but deem this a must own for film fans. From the on-disc bonus features to the poster cards, fold out poster and booklet. This is got to be on the list for Harrison Ford fans, beyond a shadow of a doubt.So, if you love a good mystery thriller Harrison Ford's Witness is one film you need to see if you haven't already. And if you have why not see it again for the first time in 4K! Head over to Amazon and order your copy of Witness today!Out of 4 Film Reels (4 being the best) Arrow Video's 4K of Witness receives....
