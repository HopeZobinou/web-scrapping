What is the Divider module?

Visual dividers are layout elements crucial in organizing on-screen content and distinguishing its components effectively. They create distinct boundaries between content pieces, making it easier to group, categorize, and organize information within a page. By aligning with the inherent patterns of visual perception, these dividers contribute to a more user-friendly and easily digestible layout, thereby enhancing the overall clarity and coherence of the design.
At Divi Pixel, we donâ€™t just follow the latest design trends; we set them. The Divider module is a prime illustration of this, as it significantly expands the spectrum of design possibilities, enabling you to craft impressive separator effects that were previously unattainable.
