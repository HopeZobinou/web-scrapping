Fund Background


The Communities Mental Health and Wellbeing Fund was first launched by Scottish Government in October 2021, responding to the impact of distress and mental ill health caused by social isolation and loneliness, as well as addressing the mental health inequalities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A second round was announced in Spring 2022, after the incredible efforts demonstrated by the third sector across Scotland, thanks to the fund. The third round was announced by Michael Matheson, MSP and Cabinet Secretary for NHS Recovery, Health and Social Care, when he visited Bonnybridge-based social enterprise, Pause and Breathe CIC, based in his Falkirk West constituency (who have previously been successful in their application to the fund).
Through the previous 2 rounds, our team has distributed around £850,000 to the Falkirk District third sector.
