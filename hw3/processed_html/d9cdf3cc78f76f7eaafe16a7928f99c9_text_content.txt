MILWAUKEE - The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Officer is investigating what police called the "suspicious death" of a child as a homicide. Family identified the boy as 12-year-old Jacarie Robinson. Police said he was found dead near 39th and Elmhurst in Milwaukee on Tuesday, Oct. 10.   The medical examiner said the boy was "malnourished," but has not yet identified him because the body was "decomposing." Police said the cause of the boy's death remains under investigation and, as of now, no one has been arrested.

Jordan said he is one of many siblings, and the news of Jacarie's death came as a shock. Another family member said he had not seen Jacarie in years. "I’m not the guy to cry, so I’m trying to be the brother, too, like dang, the big brother and like, dang, it hurt, I cried a little bit. I’m still grieving," Jordan said. "We didn’t know too much. We wish we could’ve all did better." There are missing pieces as of now, including who Jacarie lived with, when he was last seen and whether he lived at the house where he was found. A neighbor told FOX6 News they had seen the boy at the house in the past, but had not seen anyone there in a while.
