Oyster, on the other hand, harnessed the power of software to build a tech-enabled, automated, and scalable solution to help companies to hire, reward, and retain talent anywhere in the worldâall from an intuitive, easy-to-use dashboard. By leaning into modern technology and software, weâre a global employment platform (GEP) enabling companies to build and scale global teams.Thatâs why weâre thrilled to be recognized as a leader in G2âs brand new global employment platform category. Specifically, Oyster is the leader for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the new category, according to G2âs Fall 2023 report.      G2 GridÂ® for Global Employment Platforms (GEP)  ââWe are honored be named #1 in the Global Employment Platform category for SMBs. Oyster strives to deliver a product and a customer experience that empowers businesses of any size to hire, pay, and care for global talent,â says Mark Frein, Chief Operating Officer at Oyster. âWe see that small and mid-sized businesses are increasingly looking to grow their global talent footprint in order to stay competitive in a dynamic market. Thatâs why Oysterâs leadership in the GEP category is particularly meaningful. It is our intention to build on this recognition and continue to deliver an end-to-end employment solution that cuts through the complexities of international hiring.âWeâre especially pleased by this recognition because Oyster played a pivotal role in establishing the new global employment category at G2. Previously, Oyster and similar companies were listed in the multi-country payroll category. However, it became increasingly clear that these companies didnât really belong in the multi-country payroll category since payroll wasnât their primary focus. There was also a general industry trend of moving away from being service providers to being software platforms, especially as newer players entered the industry.A word from Mark Frein, Oyster's Chief Workplace OfficerThe team at Oyster presented their research to G2 to show the evolution of the industry, such as how new entrants were positioning themselves in the market, as well as evidence from recent funding news and data from organic search and paid ads. As a result of this collaboration, G2 eventually launched the new category for global employment platforms in April 2023.âWhen we get a new category request, vendors are required to provide some rationale. Why is this a good space to represent? How is it not currently being represented on the website? Where are there similarities to other categories on G2? Where are there differences?â explains Grace Savides, Market Research Analyst at G2. âThe Oyster team was kind enough to provide all of that information, and we went from there. It took many months of research, and after that long process, we created the new global employment platform (GEP) category. I want to give thanks to Oyster who really helped me out with those early conversations and helped me understand the space.âOyster is proud to be among the leaders in the G2 grid for GEPs, in addition to being the #1 GEP for small and medium-sized businesses. We know that SMBs would find it prohibitively expensive to access global talent without global employment platforms, and theyâre the market segment that has adopted this trend the fastest. So weâre especially delighted to be the #1 choice among SMBs.Weâre grateful for the recognition from G2 and hope to continue leading and innovating in the global employment space.About OysterOyster is a global employment platform designed to enable visionary HR leaders to find, engage, pay, manage, develop, and take care of a thriving distributed workforce.
