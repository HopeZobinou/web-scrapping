Election 2020
Former Aide to Mike Pence Says Trump Mocked His Own Supporters Behind Their Backs All the Time
Like you expected any different.

Olivia Troye, a former aide to Mike Pence during the Trump administration, appeared on The View on Tuesday, as most former members of that administration do. It’s almost like a nursery for tell-all books and scandalous accusations.
We knew that much was coming.



In fact, we knew that Trump’s whole schtick while he was President — indeed, the one he’s carrying on now — is a total act. It seems like yesterday he was pro-choice and inviting the Clintons to his wedding to Melania… Before he found out he could grift as a right-wing blowhard.
Then all bets were off. Despite the fact that he was nothing like the people who voted for him, he was able to appeal to their basest instincts and sell them on the idea of getting revenge on the people they felt were taking over America.

When co-host Sunny Hostin asked Troye during the show about Trump’s die-hard fans, she was to the point: “Why do you think so many people still have this blind loyalty to him? What does that say about the party now?”
Troye was no less concise in her answer, which was appalling.





“I think it speaks to an unfortunate state of the Republican Party. It is certainly not the party that I want it to be and not the party that I believe it has been in the past. I think he has done a great job of sort of marketing himself as the champion for all of these people who are behind him in this movement.



But we’ve sat in these meetings. What is so frustrating and angering to me is he has nothing in common with any of his supporters and I detest the way he speaks about them. Like, when he would talk about them in meetings, it was so disparaging to them.
I think about my own family members who, by the way, are very unhappy with me. I have a lot of family members who are still Trump supporters. They’re very upset that I’m a Trump critic. I think about them and I’m like, I hate the way you speak about them sometimes behind closed doors.”





Team Trump, of course, immediately denied that any such thing ever happened. Steven Cheung, his campaign spokesperson, told Newsweek, “Olivia Troye is an idiot and a nobody who pretends she had access while in the administration. She was a paper pusher and was routinely mocked by her peers because she online shopped the entire day.”



That sounds exactly like the kind of response you could expect from Trump.
Joy Behar then asked Troye about Pence himself, as they discussed his awful polling numbers in the primary. Troye lamented that Pence wasn’t out there saying the kinds of things she is since he went through those things too.







“I have been wanting [Pence] to take Trump on from day one, especially on January 7 of 2021. I wanted him to be out there saying, ‘This is everything that we’ve lived.’
I have tremendous respect for former Vice President Mike Pence still, I worked very closely with him. He and Trump cannot be any more different. They are very different people.”














Obviously, though, she could see the writing on the wall — Olivia Troye voted for Biden in 2020.
