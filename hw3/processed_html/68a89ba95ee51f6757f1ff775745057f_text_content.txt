IRS Agent Said CNN Has Email Where Hunter Claimed Legal ‘Stuff’ May Disappear Under Biden Admin 



 






The GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee has released a document containing an IRS agent’s response to an inquiry from a CNN producer who claimed to have an email in which Hunter Biden stated that all of his “stuff” would disappear if his father became president. The purported correspondence has never been made public.“Documents show Hunter Biden and his business associates had access to the White House and Joe Biden’s advisors; Biden business associates were instructed to not ‘mention Joe being involved’; and official trips to Ukraine line up U.S. government actions and Hunter Biden’s financial bottom line,” the Wednesday press release states.And, after the IRS began investigating these crimes, Hunter apparently “expected all of this ‘stuff’ to go away when his dad becomes President,” Just The News reported.

One of the documents involves IRS public affairs officer Justin Cole emailing two IRS officials involved in criminally looking into Hunter Biden and reporting that a CNN producer has an email from Hunter Biden in which the president’s son indicated he was “not willing to accept” a plea deal and “expected all of this ‘stuff’ to go away when his dad becomes president.”It is unknown when the email from Hunter Biden was sent.A message from Hunter Biden’s Apple iCloud backup on June 6, 2017, obtained by the committee, depicts him conversing with his uncle, Jim Biden, about his family’s “brand.”“Bullsh-t James – all around bullsh-t,” Hunter Biden wrote. “Explain to me one thing Tony brings to MY table that I so desperately need that I’m willing to sign over my family’s brand and pretty much the rest of my business life? Read the f-cking documents people It’s plane f-cking English. Why in gods name would I give this marginal bully the keys my family’s only asset? Why?”



House Oversight Committee members have said they will present all evidence uncovered to date in their investigation into the Biden family’s business dealings while examining “the value” of the inquiry, which will take place the next day, the night before the newly released documents.“The House Oversight and Accountability Committee has uncovered a mountain of evidence revealing how Joe Biden abused his public office for his family’s financial gain,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said in his opening statement.“For years, President Biden has lied to the American people about his knowledge of and participation in his family’s corrupt business schemes,” Comer added.House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan has announced a timeline for testimony before the panel from David Weiss, the U.S. attorney-turned-special counsel who recently indicted first son Hunter Biden on a gun-related charge.



Jordan said on Sunday that Weiss will testify before the House on Oct. 18 during a Fox News interview.“David Weiss has committed to come in front of the committee on Oct. 18, so we can look forward to that,” Jordan said, as reported by Newsmax.Jordan also presented alleged evidence linking President Joe Biden to his son, who, according to his attorney George Mesires, served on the board of Ukrainian energy corporation Burisma Holdings from 2014 to 2019.“You can boil this” question of Joe Biden’s alleged corruption “down to the Burisma situation,” Jordan noted further.“Burisma, I think, captures it all. Hunter Biden gets put on the board; gets paid a lot of money. Fact No. 2: He wasn’t qualified to be on the board. Fact No. 3: The Burisma executives asked him, ‘Can you help us with the pressure we are facing?’ Fact No. 4: Joe Biden gets [Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin] fired — leverages American tax dollars to accomplish that,” he continued.“And then what does the [Attorney General Merrick] Garland Justice Department do?” Jordan asked. “They try to sweep it under the rug, so much so that they allowed the statute of limitations to lapse for the most serious … felony tax concerns Hunter Biden had in 2014 and 2015. They let it lapse because those were the years that dealt with the Burisma income,” he noted further.As the Ohio Republican’s committee prepares for Weiss’s testimony, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) announced late last week that President Biden’s first impeachment inquiry hearing is set for Sept. 28.The developments come as the White House has appealed to allies in the “media to ramp up its scrutiny of House Republicans for opening an impeachment inquiry based on lies.”After he left the vice presidency, Biden famously admitted to what appeared to be a “quid pro quo” during an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations.Biden said he had traveled to Kyiv on orders from then-President Barack Obama and demanded that the prosecutor be fired or he would withhold $1 billion in assistance.
