F1: Pirelli awarded new deal to supply tyres until at least 2027By Andrew BensonChief F1 writerLast updated on 10 October 202310 October 2023.From the section Formula 1Pirelli has supplied Formula 1 with tyres exclusively since 2011Pirelli will continue to supply tyres to Formula 1 until at least the end of the 2027 season after being awarded a new contract.The agreement, first reported by BBC Sport, will begin in 2025.The Italian brand has fended off competition from Japan's Bridgestone company to extend its stint as F1's sole tyre manufacturer to 18 years.As part of the new deal, all F1 tyres will be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council from 2024 onwards.This ensures full traceability of forest-based materials in the supply chain and ensures tree plantations are managed in a way that preserves biological diversity.FSC certification is also aimed at benefitting the lives of local communities and workers and fostering economic sustainability.That brings tyre production in line with F1's wider environmental and sustainability aims, with the sport having pledged to go net-zero carbon by 2030.Synthetic sustainable e-fuels are set to be introduced along with a new set of technical rules for 2026, including engines which have a much larger hybrid component.F1 president Stefano Domenicali said in a statement that Pirelli had been an "invaluable partner" of F1.He added: "Their commitment to quality, innovation, and their deep knowledge of our sport will be vital in the coming years as we approach our new regulations in 2026."The work Pirelli is focused on relating to sustainability, proven by the FSC certification, will ensure we continue to work together towards our shared Net Zero 2030 goal."Pirelli beat Bridgestone to deal but could still be planning eventual exitPirelli's announcement does not mention the fact that this contract is expected to be the company's last in F1, but insiders have told BBC Sport that this has been discussed with Domenicali.The deal includes an option for a further year in 2028 on the side of F1 and governing body the FIA.There was pressure on Domenicali from some quarters to switch to Bridgestone, a brand highly respected across motorsport, but he preferred to stick with a known quantity as F1 heads into an era which will include a rules transition.The fact that Bridgestone, which was in F1 from 1998 to 2010, would have had to build two types of new tyre in the first two years of its contract as a result of the rule change was a key factor in the decision.Insiders say Domenicali has discussed with Bridgestone the idea of taking over from Pirelli in 2028, but that the conversations are not yet especially well developed.Biles vs the rest in gymnastics' grand finale!
