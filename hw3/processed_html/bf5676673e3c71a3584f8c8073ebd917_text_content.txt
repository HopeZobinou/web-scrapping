The agency had diligently crafted a stunning website with an impressive online store, while the client had populated it with their valuable products for sale. The grand launch of the website garnered attention, even catching the eye of Googlebot. Orders began pouring in at a rapid pace, bringing immense joy to the client.However, amidst the success, an unforeseen calamity struck. The exact nature of the problem wasn't immediately apparent, but it was clear that something was amiss, and the situation was bound to worsen.This is where our story unfolds, joining the agency as they strive to divert the attention of malicious actors away from the exquisite online store.6:30PM (UTC)How to Rescue Disgruntled ClientsBrad WilliamsFounder/CEO, WebDevStudiosPhil WylieLead Developer, Kanuka Digital+A common experience when onboarding a new client is that they had a super difficult/negative experience with a previous developer. Only after developing a chip on their shoulder have they turned to a professional to "get this done right." It is here that so many of us meet and must begin building a relationship. We've reached out to two different Certified Woo Experts to share their experience and help you navigate these waters and become better collaborators.If you're a store owner, this provides a great lesson on how to work with an agency or independent dev. If you're an independent or part of an agency, this will help you lead more productive conversations and more easily reach everyone's desired outcome.7:30PM (UTC)Do the Woo Recap - Day 01Robert JacobiIndustry Analyst & StrategistZach StepekClient Enablement Manager, Convesio+More details coming soon!October 11th, 2023Expand All4:00PM (UTC)A More Human Touch Through RobotsJob ThomasHead of Support, WooCommerce+In 2023, Woo's customer support team doubled down on A.I. tools.

This approach enables you to effectively guide shoppers towards making a purchase decision, a crucial aspect of driving sales.In an era of diminishing attention spans, we have only limited time to capture a shopper's interest and motivate them to take action.

Key topics covered will include strategies for securing the privacy of user data, the use of first-party sets instead of third-party sets to enhance privacy safeguards, and exploring additional best practices for maintaining user privacy.
