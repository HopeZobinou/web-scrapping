Privacy NoticeThe Green Brigade have accused the Celtic board of 'hypocrisy' and urged Hoops fans to show their support of Palestine on the Champions League stage. The Parkhead club last night slammed the fan group for their pro-Palestine banners at the weekend and urged supporters to keep political views away from football. The ultras group, housed in the North Curve section of the stadium, unveiled a large display which read: "Free Palestine. Victory To The Resistance!" It came just hours after Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel which killed hundreds of innocent civilians, with Israel responding by bombarding the Gaza Strip. The show of solidarity prompted a furious response from former player Nir Bitton, who branded the fan group "brainwashed". Celts chiefs last night condemned the banners by claiming "political messages and banners are not welcome at Celtic Park". But the Green Brigade have hit back in a stinging statement, vowing they will "not be dictated to by an elitist board that has repeatedly demonstrated contempt for the history and traditions of Celtic Football Club."

 Liel Abada speaks out as Celtic star posts emotional message after Parkhead meeting

  It read: "Following a recent Celtic PLC statement, we would like to reiterate our unshakable belief that we, and other football supporters, have the right to express political views on the terraces, just as ordinary citizens do elsewhere in society. "Football remains one of the few areas of public life where working-class people have genuine political agency, and we will not be dictated to by an elitist board that has repeatedly demonstrated contempt for the history and traditions of Celtic Football Club. "Celtic was born out of famine oppression, a product of colonial rule, death and the mass displacement of people. It is because of this history that Celtic fans are renowned for their empathy and solidarity; consistently siding with the oppressed and destitute. This fact is not lost on the PLC as it regularly flirts with the idea, particularly where it can be commodified, yet the board are quick to condemn when the views expressed challenge their worldview, disingenuously then proclaiming to be apolitical. "The current hypocrisy of the PLC is sadly in step with much of the political and media class, epitomised through the example of Ukraine. Political messaging was welcome at Celtic Park then; yet is being condemned now. The question on any reasonable mind should be why? Why are Ukranian lives more sacred then Palestinian lives? "The Green Brigade remain unequivocal in our support for the Palestinian people, as we have been consistently. We have supported various Palestinian projects throughout our history and for over a decade have developed a close relationship with Aida Refugee Camp culminating in the formation of the Aida Celtic football academy in Bethlehem.  "We send our sincere solidarity and prayers to our friends across all of Palestine at this traumatic time when yet again much of the international community turns its back in cowardice while war crimes are inflicted on a largely defenceless, imprisoned population. "We call on the Celtic support - the true custodians of Celtic Football Club - to stand on the right side of history. In 2016, we defiantly raised the flag and matched the fine for Palestine. Now, more than ever, the Palestinian people need our solidarity. "On 25th October vs Atletico Madrid, we ask all Celtic fans to raise the Palestine flag on the European stage and show the world that Celtic Football Club stands with the oppressed, not the oppressor. We must apply learning from apartheid South Africa to dismantle apartheid Israel - if we are neutral in situations of injustice, we have chosen the side of the oppressor. In the meantime, we encourage fans to donate to the MAP Gaza Emergency Fund."
