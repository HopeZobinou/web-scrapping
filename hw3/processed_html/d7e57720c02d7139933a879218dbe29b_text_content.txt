In Extra Medium | John Muse, the gallery is divided: in the front, clusters of framed collages, a vitrine of journals and smaller works, and a large video projection of cut and painted paper; in the back, a studio where Muse works for the duration of the exhibition on more video, more collages, and more journals. Employing everyday tools, a modest vocabulary of shapes and forms, and found and made materials, Muse makes images that invite sustained attention, blunt swift decoding, and probe the difference between abstraction and figuration. Curated by Homay King, the exhibition is accompanied by a broadsheet publication, a program of Muse’s short films, and interactive games featuring guest collaborators.
This exhibition includes a strobe effect






Extra Medium | John Muse is made possible with support from The John B. Hurford ’60 Center for the Arts and Humanities and the Distinguished Visitors Program.
