We compiled a list of the best 20 web hosting providers in this post. They are prominent companies which you can opt to host your personal, business, and e-commerce portals and blogs.

Why Web Hosting is important?
A web hosting service acts as a foundation for your online venture. It hosts a website in enterprise-graded servers and makes it accessible to the visitors always even while you are sleeping.
A good hosting company will guarantee more than 99% uptime to the customers. The uptime covers the percentage of time for which the website is publicly accessible, reachable on the internet. Maximum uptime means a website is in online for almost every time which will boost your page visits and income also.
Before signing up a hosting contract, confirm what percentage of uptime they offer. Compare it with verified user reviews that you can find on Google or ask experts in your niche to collect honest opinions and ensure that everything is on the track.
Page loading time and security are other major things where a quality web host can bring significant changes. The pages should load faster in all device types. So Google will place them in top results and visitors will spend more time on your website. But a website’s speed depends on the quality of hosting and their optimization tools to some extent. If they are reluctant to adopt the latest technologies into practice or stick to the outdated servers, your site will take more time to load and may go offline frequently.
Cybercriminals attempt to hack websites every moment through login forms and malicious code injections. A web host should be able to prevent them in advance. Otherwise, it will create serious consequences for business owners. Adding most modern security environments and implementing regular updates from the server-side are proven methods to safeguard websites against cyberattacks and vulnerabilities.
