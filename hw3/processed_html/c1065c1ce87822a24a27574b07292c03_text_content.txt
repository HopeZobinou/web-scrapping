AUSA 23 – SIG Medium Range Gas Gun – Sniper Program Submission

Although Geissele won the USSOCOM Medium Range Gas Gun – Sniper competition, SIG showed us the art of the possible with the SPEAR platform by exhibiting their MRGG-S candidate weapon.

MRGG (pronounced Margie at SOCOM) is a 6.5 CM rifle designed as a seni-auto sniper support rifle. As you can see, it sports a 20″ barrel and adjustable buttstock. The optic is a SIG TANGO6T which is a place holder for a customer directed optic.

Here are some close ups of the controls and buttstock.

That stock is nightmare fuel. But if it works it works…

Regardless of performance or weight, I can see why the Geissele option won the contract. Jeez that is ugly. And I can imagine it is ridiculously front heavy and imbalanced. It looks like they did massive weight reduction in the stock in order to make the contractual weight requirement threshold.

It’s also baffling to me why they would submit it with such a limited handguard length.

Think you hit the nail on the head there, I hadn’t thought of weight requirements as the driver of the handguard and stock design. Looks ungainly as heck.
