        Abstract
        
      



          Background and aims:
        
      
      Public health measures introduced to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely affected opioid supply and demand, as well as the patterns and contexts of opioid use. We measured opioid-related harms during the first 2 years of COVID-19 restrictions in Victoria, Australia.
    


          Design:
        
      
      We adopted an interrupted time series analysis design using interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Opioid-related ambulance attendance data between January 2015 and March 2022 were extracted from the National Ambulance Surveillance System.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Victoria, Australia.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Patients (≥15 years) attended to by an ambulance for opioid-related harms.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      Monthly opioid-related ambulance attendances for three drug types: heroin, prescription opioids and opioid agonist therapy (OAT) medications.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The monthly rate of heroin-related attendances fell by 26% immediately after the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions. A reduced rate of heroin-related attendances was observed during COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in 2578 averted heroin-related attendances. There was no change in the rate of attendances for extra-medical OAT medications or prescription opioids.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Strict COVID-19 restrictions in Victoria, Australia appear to have resulted in a substantial reduction in heroin-related ambulance attendances, perhaps because of border closures and restrictions on movement affecting supply, changing patterns of drug consumption, and efforts to improve access to OAT. Despite policy changes allowing longer OAT prescriptions and an increased number of unsupervised doses, we found no evidence of increased harms related to the extra-medical use of these medications.
