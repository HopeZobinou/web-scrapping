Filetype Folly 











 Sometimes when you try to upload media to your website, the filetype might not be supported. If you’re using a website builder, double check the settings and documentation, as sometimes, the supported file types can be added to. 



If your filetype is completely unusable, (which can happen with images such as .webp), then your next option is to convert the file. With images, you can open the image in image editing software like Photoshop or Paint.net, and then re-save it with a different file extension such as .jpg or .png – alternatively, there are numerous filetype conversion websites available out there – simply Google “webp to jpg converter”!
