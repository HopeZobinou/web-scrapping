Aaron Terrell, a trans man, was evicted from WPATH's Annual Scientific Symposium for asking clinicians about their research on medical interventions for minors.A 28-year-old flight attendant became the first transgender contestant to take home the title of Miss Portugal, adding to the number headed to the Miss Universe competition in El Salvador next month.    "Proud to be the first trans woman to compete for the Miss Universe Portugal title!" Marina Machete wrote in an Instagram post before the competition. "For many years I wasn’t eligible to compete and now it’s such an honor to be a part of this incredible group of candidates!"  TRANSWOMAN MODEL WINS MISS UNIVERSE NETHERLANDS IN HISTORIC MOMENT: ‘I DID IT’  Machete will be the second transgender contestant headed to the Miss Universe competition next month, competing against Rikkie Valerie Kollé, another transgender contestant who made history by becoming the first biological male to claim the crown in the Netherlands in July.  Machete celebrated the win in a separate post."We're counting down to @missuniverse 2023," the post read, translated from Portuguese. "El Salvador, see you soon!"  Contestant Rikkie Kollé poses after being crowned winner in the Miss Netherlands beauty pageant in Leusden on July 8, 2023.

"They [critics] see us as monsters, and my daily DMs are full of people wishing me dead," Kollé told Newsweek at the time, adding, "Wishing me dead and telling me to [commit] suicide, those things are terrible to write, but at the same it's only lifting me up because I get a bigger platform than I could ever dream of."    Kollé also said competing as a transgender contender offers a space to represent the LGBTQ+ community, adding, "Let's make my Queer community proud by doing this."
