Lebanese-American adult actress Mia Khalifa was reportedly fired from men's lifestyle magazine Playboy after expressing her support for Palestine amid its war with Israel.
According to a report by The Independent, Playboy—in an email sent to its users—said it also deleted Khalifa's channel on its creator platform.
"Over the past few days, Mia has made disgusting and reprehensible comments celebrating Hamas’ attacks on Israel and the murder of innocent men, women and children," it said.
"At Playboy, we encourage free expression and constructive political debate, but we have zero tolerance policy for hate speech."




"We expect Mia to understand that her words and actions have consequences," it added.

What we know so far about the Hamas assault on Israel





On Oct. 7, a Palestinian militant group called Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing thousands as of writing. Hamas also took over hostages in Israel.
The attack is a dramatic escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict that started in 1948.
On X (formerly Twitter), Khalifa urged "freedom fighters" in Palestine to "flip their phones and film horizontal." Users were quick to criticize her for "condoning" death, beatings, and hostages.
She then quote-tweeted one user, saying she just "wanna make sure there’s 4K footage of my people breaking down the walls of the open air prison they’ve been forced out of their homes and into." This, she said, would allow for "good options for the history books that write about how they freed themselves from apartheid.”
"I stand with all people fighting oppression, now and always," Khalifa said in a reply to a user. "I’m from LEBANON, are you insane for expecting me to be on the side of colonialism you f**king weirdo."
In response to another user, she also clarified she's "in no way, shape, or form" enticing the spread of violence. She noted that she "specifically" used the term "freedom fighters" as Palestinian citizens are "fighting for freedom every day."
