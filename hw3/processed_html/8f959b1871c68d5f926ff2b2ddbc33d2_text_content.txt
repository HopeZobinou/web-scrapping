No Comments on WooCommerce 8.2.0 Released 







We are pleased to announce the release of¬†WooCommerce 8.2.0. This release should be backwards compatible with the previous version.
This release contains:

622 commits from 55 contributors¬†in WooCommerce Core.
107 commits from 28 contributors¬†in WooCommerce Blocks.

As always, we recommend creating a backup of your site and making sure that your theme and any other plugins are compatible before updating. You can check out¬†this update guide¬†for more information.
PHP Requirement Change
WooCommerce 8.2 requires PHP version 7.4 or newer.
Read our announcement post for full details.
What‚Äôs new in 8.2.0?
High Performance Order Storage
High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS)¬†also previously known as ‚ÄúCustom Order Tables‚Äù is a solution that provides an easy-to-understand and solid database structure ‚Äì specifically designed for eCommerce needs. It uses the WooCommerce CRUD design to store order data in custom tables ‚Äì optimized for WooCommerce queries with minimal impact on the store‚Äôs performance.¬†
In January 2022, we published the¬†initial plan for the Custom Order Tables feature¬†and since then, we‚Äôve been working hard to bring the High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) to WooCommerce Core. In May 2022, we invited you to¬†test the order migration process¬†and provide feedback on how our initial work performs on real stores of varied configurations.
High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS)¬†is officially released in 8.2.0 under the stable flag and is enabled by default for new installations.
Bringing High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) to WooCommerce improves these three essential properties for eCommerce stores.¬†

Scalability

The rise in the number of customers and customer orders increases the load on your store‚Äôs database ‚Äì making it difficult to handle customer order requests and deliver a seamless user experience.
With High-Performance Order Storage, you get dedicated tables for data like orders and order addresses and thus dedicated indexes which results in fewer read/write operations and fewer busy tables. This feature enables eCommerce stores of all shapes and sizes to scale their business to their maximum potential ‚Äì without expert intervention.¬†

Reliability¬†

High-Performance Order Storage makes implementing and restoring targeted data backup easier. You‚Äôll no longer need to worry about losing orders, inventory numbers, or client information with reliable backup in these custom order tables. It‚Äôll also facilitate implementing read/write locks and prevent race conditions.

Simplicity¬†

You no longer have to go through a single huge database to locate underlying data and WooCommerce entries.¬†
With High-Performance Order Storage, you can easily browse through the separate tables and easy-to-handle entries, independent of the table¬†_posts, to find data or understand the table structure. It also lets you easily develop new plugins, implement designs for shops and products, and modify WooCommerce with more flexibility.
Please visit the documentation page for more details on the High-Performance Order Storage.  
Improve WooCommerce blocks performance for classic themes
We made some changes that will split out the styles for our blocks into individual CSS files when the site uses a classic theme. This has been the case for some time with block themes, and now classic themes can benefit from faster load times and lower resource usage when displaying WooCommerce blocks.
More patterns in the Product Collection block
Two new Product Collection patterns, Rows and Simple Grid, are now available. They offer vertical and horizontal layouts to better showcase products.

New Product Collection block
Product Collection is the newest addition to our block library.
Like the Products block, you can choose what criteria affect the list of blocks displayed to shoppers and control the product layout in the list/grid by the various element blocks.
Unlike the Products block, which is a¬†Query¬†loop block variation, this block is a standalone block, enabling us to tailor the block further to better meet the¬†merchant‚Äôs needs.
Existing templates with Product blocks will remain unchanged as we haven‚Äôt replaced them with Product Collection blocks yet.
It‚Äôs labeled beta because we‚Äôre still polishing it. And we look forward to any feedback you have on this block.

Other changes
For a complete list of the changes included in this release, please see the changelog in the readme for this release.
Much¬†üíú¬†to all the contributors
Finally a big thanks to everyone in the community who has contributed via issue reports, fixes, translation, testing, supporting other users, or simply spreading the word.
