The other day, I was searching the web and came across a WordPress blog post about code refactoring. Nothing newsworthy there, but something jumped off the page and caught my attention, maybe because the iThemes-SolidWP rebrand has dominated my thoughts for nearly a year: proper justification and clear rationale.
iThemes’ evolution to SolidWP is complete. Learn how our re-engineered product line provides a solid foundation for every WordPress website you build. Most importantly, learn about the changes we made with you — the user — in mind.
Proper justification and clear rationale,1 one of the sniff tests that code refactoring must pass to be considered a valuable use of resources. 

That’s what I want to share with you: The justification and rationale behind the SolidWP product enhancements and our decision to focus on products that form a solid foundation for every WordPress website you build. Plugin development that doesn’t have user needs central to its vision ultimately serves no one. iThemes, now SolidWP, built its brand on being user-centric. The rebranding and re-engineering of our core products is no different. 

We’re most excited about the integration of Patchstack into Solid Security Pro. This means you don’t need to jump on every vulnerability the second you learn about it — we do it for you. And, you don’t need to worry about vulnerabilities for which the developer has issued no patch — we patch it for you. 
We call it always-on security and it’s a game changer for site builders, developers, solopreneurs, and really anyone who takes security seriously but can’t be everywhere all at once all the time. 
This is a significant change in our product and one that is centered solely on you, the user. Check out our awesome demo for Solid Security with developer Timothy Jacobs. 
Cybercriminals are getting more sophisticated every day. It’s challenging for WordPress site builders and developers to stay ahead of them. Adding a safety net like Patchstack is our way of saying, “We’ve got your back.” 

Other enhancements to Solid Security – both Basic and Pro – we think you’ll benefit from are: 

New and improved UI/UX
Dedicated User Security Screen
New vulnerabilities screen
Improved site scanner


Proper justification and clear rationale for improvements are at the heart of our work on Solid Backups (formerly iThemes Backup Buddy). 
With Solid Backups we bring you increased stability and improved usability. Reliability, peace of mind, and ease of use are central to any backup solution. We check the box in each of these areas with Solid Backups. 
Watch the video detailing our work on the file restore process to see how we’ve simplified the process from start to finish. 
One piece of customer feedback we took great care to act on was the impact on server load during the backup process. Our activation scheduler calculates what your server can handle when batching file move jobs. We also have automated verification that the files you selected to restore were successfully restored! 
Users will also benefit from: 

Improved compatibility with Dropbox, G Drive, S3, & more
User-pleasing design and UI/UX refresh
Major code refactor



Ease of use and improved visibility into important site functions are at the heart of our work on Solid Central (formerly iThemes Sync). 
The health and performance of the websites you manage aren’t important only when you’re sitting at your desk. You need visibility when you’re on the go as well, which is why we improved mobile styling and ensured that you can view all actions from your dashboard on a mobile device. Click here to see our demo. 
You’ll also appreciate: 

A redesigned reporting section where you can see everything you need upfront in a clean, sleek way. 
Revamped UI 
Better integration with Solid Security and Solid Backups 
Bulk actions like plugin and theme updates save you tons of time
