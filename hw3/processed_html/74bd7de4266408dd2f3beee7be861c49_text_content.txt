Florida Family Get Serious Prison Time for Selling Bleach as a Cure for COVID After Trump Suggested It
How can anyone not understand what a danger Trump is?

Okay, let’s be fair. The vast majority of people who heard Trump talking about injecting cleaning solutions in order to get rid of COVID-19 already knew he was an idiot. There was no way people were going to do that, right?
If that were only the case, the Grenon family in Florida wouldn’t have been able to sell tens of thousands of bottles of toxic bleaching solution as a miracle cure for the sometimes-deadly virus.



How did they do it? Simple, really. They just created a fake church called “Genesis II Church of Health & Healing.” From there, it was an easy matter of coming up with a name for the liquid they sold. “Miracle Mineral Solution,” filled with sodium chlorite, is what they settled on.
While not chemically identical to bleach, it is a bleaching agent that will kill you if ingested in large enough amounts, even cumulatively.

The Department of Justice said in a statement, “The Grenons claimed that ingesting MMS could treat, prevent, and cure COVID-19. The FDA, however, had not approved MMS for treatment of COVID-19, or for any other use. Rather … the FDA had strongly urged consumers not to purchase or use MMS for any reason, explaining that drinking MMS was the same as drinking bleach.”
I get that the kind of person who would buy a “miracle cure” for anything from anyone isn’t necessarily the kind of person who gives a crap what the Food and Drug Administration says.





But if a guy who was naked under a trenchcoat in a city park told me I was about to drink bleach, I would at least think twice about it. Honestly, the Grenons’ conviction and sentencing is as much of a statement about the stupidity of Trump followers as it is about how devious the family is.



Mark Grenon and his sons Jonathan, Jordan, and Joseph all got prison time for their roles in the scheme. The two older brothers, Jonathan and Jordan, who were more responsible for the distribution of the substance, got nearly 13 years in prison each. The father, Mark, and his other son Joseph, each got 5 years in prison.
