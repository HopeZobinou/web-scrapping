Sora News 24 reports that the ghoulish drink is made using a bitter caramel sauce, and at the bottom you'll find a sweet pumpkin pudding. And the all-black treats don't stop there. Starbucks Japan will also be releasing a Halloween Chocolate Cake for the holiday. Like the Booooo Frappuccino, the Halloween Chocolate Cake also boasts a jet-black color and a surprising flavor profile.StarbucksDesigned to “fascinate with its suspicious pitch black appearance," the cake features a crunchy chocolate coating and a cupcake-like interior of moist black cocoa cake dough and purple blueberry cream. From the looks of the photo, it appears that you can also get the sweet pumpkin pudding used in the Booooo Frappuccino on its own. The spooky selections will be available from October 11 to October 31. Unfortunately, there's no word yet on if any U.S. Starbucks locations will be getting these Halloween-inspired treats.
