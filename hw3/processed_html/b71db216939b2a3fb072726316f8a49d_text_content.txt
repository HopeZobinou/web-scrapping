The concept of a decentralized cloud service refers to a system that operates on a distributed network of computers rather than relying on a centralized infrastructure. io.net has recently declared its objective of establishing the most extensive Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) for Artificial Intelligence (AI) on a global scale. 
io.net intends to address the scarcity of GPUs for AI processing by procuring one million units from independent computing power sources. During the course of its development, it will establish the first decentralized cloud environment specifically designed for machine learning, according to the latest information shared with Finbold on October 11.
Since the rise of AI, GPU power has become an extremely valuable commodity. The price of training large-scale AI models has increased by roughly 3,100% annually, while demand for GPUs increases by a factor of 10 every 18 months.  This has resulted in higher prices and longer wait times for access to cloud services, inhibiting innovation and making it difficult for AI firms to get their feet off the ground. 
io.net intends to fix this by putting to use the unused GPU power of computers all around the globe. This includes cryptocurrency mining farms, whose income has plummeted since Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake, and independent data centers, whose usual usage rate is barely 12-18%.
Io.net will compete with established cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure by making GPU processing more affordable, adaptable, and easily available. As a result of their efforts, large GPU clusters that can handle demanding machine learning workloads may be deployed with a single click and go live in under a minute. io.net claims to be able to provide GPU computation for as much as 90% less than current market leaders.
Building a global network of user-supplied GPUs 
To accomplish these goals, io.net seeks to build a worldwide network of user-supplied GPUs utilizing a rewards system that encourages involvement. Miners, independent data centers with underused computing capacity, and crypto projects with access to GPU computation are likely to be providers. GPU suppliers will be compensated for the computation they give, resulting in a robust market that will help the AI sector thrive.
Ahmad Shadid, Founder and CEO of io.net, noted: 

“AI is one step away from starting the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but current GPU providers can’t support the scale and speed of innovation. io.net will be able to connect one million GPUs distributed across the globe in under 90 seconds, giving AI startups access to essential processing power on demand.”

The onboarding of crypto mining farms with massive quantities of GPU power and profit margins that have been cut in the present market situation is critical to attaining these goals. io.net estimates that repurposing their farms for GPU providing might result in a 1,500% increase in earnings while using less energy. As it approaches its one million GPU objective, io.net already has 36,000 GPUs at its disposal.
