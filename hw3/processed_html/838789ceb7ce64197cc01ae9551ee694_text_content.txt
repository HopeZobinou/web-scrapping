HostArmada Review
Pin
I am a HostArmada customer for the last two years. Earlier, I was using WPX Hosting. Unfortunately, their basic plan allows you to host 5 websites only. But I have more websites, including redirected domains. So I shifted to HostArmada’s unlimited cloud WordPress hosting plan. 

Initially, I created a testing site on HostArmada and waited for a few days to evaluate its performance. The results were impressive, with no significant downtime. Then, I migrated production websites one by one with the help of their migration experts. 
I’m not wrong. Here’s the proof, 
Pin
My site loads fast with 100% performance score and full green signals from Core Web Vitals. It delivers the largest content element in just 194 milliseconds. No CDN connected. Not using any premium caching plugins. Yet all our websites load as if from a premium hosting service. 

Website speed is a crucial factor to increase your search engine rankings and boost user experience. With speed boosting cloud architecture and LiteSpeed enabled SSD server technology, HostArmada is one of the best hosting service for any website type. It is safe and affordable too. So you can choose it as your web host without a second thought.

HostArmada has a 24/7/365 customer support to address your queries and solve complaints as fast as possible. 

They have a 45-days money-back guarantee in all hosting plans. If you are not satisfied with HostArmada hosting, contact them during this period and ask for a full refund. You will get it. No questions will be asked.

Click here to visit HostArmada and choose a hosting plan with up to 70% off (Limited period offer)
Advantages of HostArmada Hosting
HostArmada is fast, reliable, and stable hosting provider. Let us check the top reasons for choosing as your web host.
1. Free domain
A domain is your key to the online market, and it represents your business. HostArmada provides a free domain to make a perfect start and cut short your hosting bill. It supports all popular domain extensions, including generic and country-specific. 

Drag and drop website builder is another advantage. It helps you to design websites from scratch using more than 800 premium-quality themes available in their in-house library. Pick a template that you like, enter website details, and install. You are ready to go.
2. Free migration
HostArmada has free migration in all hosting plans. After selecting your plan and making the payment, create a migration request and add your current host’s login credentials. Their migration experts will do the rest. 

They will transfer your entire website to the new destination without losing even a single file. You can just sit back and relax. Free migration limits will vary based on the hosting plan you choose. Any additional transfer can do for as low as $9.99 per site. 
3. Managed hosting
HostArmada hosts all websites on managed hosting environment. So you don’t have to worry about website security, optimization, or backup. They will monitor your website in real-time to detect and block security threats, help you to optimize pages and increase performance, and backup content every day to the cloud. 
Pin
You’ll be able to update core files, themes, and plugins automatically via cPanel setting. HostArmada has a user-friendly control panel to manage all website related tools—email accounts, domains, caching, and others—from one place. 

Create unlimited email accounts, check emails right from your cPanel, or redirect them to your primary email accounts such as Gmail. You can do all these things in a few clicks. If you don’t know how to manage settings, contact customer care, and they will guide you with step-by-step instructions. 
4. Performance
HostArmada’s robust infrastructure, cloud-based servers, and the latest hosting technologies will help you run websites at high-speed. LiteSpeed web servers are much faster than traditional Apache servers, hence you will get improved performance and security with them.

HostArmada places fewer clients in each server and offers 3 times more resources to maximize your web performance (In the Speed Reaper plan). Hosting your websites on cloud SSD eliminates the need to use a third party CDN. But you can use Key CDN, Cloudflare or any other Content Delivery Network if needed. We’re not using any CDN, but our pages load faster as you know. 

If you are still facing any performance issues, contact their customer support, and they will run a free loading speed optimization to improve your delivery time. The reality is that Cloud connected SSD servers combined with LiteSpeed caching and advanced optimization practices will not create such a situation. The biggest proof of this is that I have never had to contact customer support for page speed optimization in all this time.
5. High uptime
HostArmada offers 99.9% uptime guarantee, which is the industrial best figure. The fact is that many hosting companies make such promises but do not keep them. But HostArmada is different from them.
Here’s the proof,
Pin
BloggingTriggers is up for more than 7 months (100% uptime) without any interruption. It’s average response time is 67.84 milliseconds, which is also a decent figure.
6. Truly unlimited
You will get unlimited bandwidth, unlimited emails, unlimited databases, and unlimited subdomains on HostArmada hosting. The SSD storage is limited, even though, since it is cloud based, the allotted space will be more than enough for you.

HostArmada’s unlimited hosting starts at $3.74/mo at this time. It is a limited period offer. If you are planning to host unlimited websites, this is the perfect time to start. It comes with 30 GB SSD storage, unlimited add-on domains, private DNS, and other features we discussed above.
7. Advanced security
Enhanced security is a main advantage of HostArmada hosting. It monitors websites 24/7 to detect possible hacking attempts, security loopholes, infections, and other threats that may affect your installation. AI-based firewall is another part which uses advanced artificial intelligence technology to defend against brute-force attacks, DDoS attacks, and more.

Malware infection is one of the main threats every website owner faces. It will affect your online reputation, search rankings, and overall revenue. Luckily, HostArmada runs a regular malware scan on your site and if any threat is found, remove them instantly.
No fees. No need to hire security experts to fix things.
HostArmada’s in-house security team will do it freely before your website is getting infected. They will remove infections safely to protect your income stream and avoid Google penalties. 
This host will also run daily backups to safeguard your precious content against unexpected loss or accidental deletion. If somehow your data is lost, ask support engineers to restore your website to a previous state. They will come back with a list of available backups (up to 21). Pick a backup version, and they will restore your site in a few minutes. 
8. Data centers
HostArmada has servers in the United States (California, Texas, and New Jersey), Canada (Toronto), UK (London), Denmark (Frankfurt), India (Mumbai), Singapore, and Australia (Sydney).
Pick a data center nearest to your target audience and serve your eCommerce shopping portals, blog posts, portfolios, and all other content types in matchless speed. 
9. Positive reviews
Pin
HostArmada has 4.9/5.0 rating from more than 472 reviews in Trustpilot. It indicates that the existing customers are highly satisfied with their services. 99% of them marked the host’s performance as excellent. 
We started using HostArmada in 2020. Later, we extended the subscription for another two years. Here’s the proof, 
Pin
10. Fast customer support
HostArmada has a 24/7 fast customer support. You can reach them anytime via phone, email, chat, and tickets. If you have any queries regarding website performance or facing any hosting-related issues, contact their friendly customer support, and they will fix things as early as possible.

They also have a huge knowledge base to guide you on various things like website builder, FTP service, WordPress installation, etc. So you can solve related issues without seeking anyone’s help.
11. 45-days money-back guarantee
HostArmada provides 45-days money-back guarantee in all shared and WordPress hosting plans. It is like a free hosting trial. 

Test their service during this period and if not satisfied, contact their customer support and ask for a refund. They will either solve your complaint or issue a full refund after deducting domain registration charges. So there is no risk in trying HostArmada hosting.

If you are a beginner, the basic Web Warp plan may be enough for you. It comes with single website hosting, 15 GB cloud SSD storage, and other essential features. But if you have money, I suggest you to go with their Speed Reaper plan. It lets you host unlimited websites with 40 GB cloud SSD storage. Powered by LiteSpeed caching, it ensures improved performance on your websites.
LiteSpeed servers are 10 times faster than traditional Apache servers. So choosing the Speed Reaper plan helps you to create lighting-fast websites and rank higher in search engine result pages. It also provides 3 times CPU and RAM and places 3 times fewer clients per server. All these features make it the best shared hosting plan for any business type.
If you use a fast WordPress theme like Astra with this type of hosting, your pages are going to be loading in no time!
Currently, HostArmada runs promo deals on all hosting types. So you can buy their packages at low cost for a limited period. It is better to choose a suitable plan as soon as possible as the price will change in the nearby future.

FAQ

Do you need hosting for WordPress?There are two types of WordPress—WordPress.org and WordPress.com. WordPress.org is a self-hosted open-source software which is free. But you need a hosting provider to install WordPress.org and host websites. WordPress.com is also free. It is a website builder with in-house hosting capabilities. Free users can create websites with a subdomain like example.wordpress.com. To connect to a custom domain like www.example.com, you should buy a hosting plan from WordPress.com. Their pricing starts at $4 per month. 
Which is better WordPress.org vs WordPress.com?WordPress.org is the best choice. It is easy to manage and flexible. There are thousands of free and premium WordPress themes and plugins available for website management. Being open-source, you can also build custom themes and plugins to apply a unique touch to your website. On the other hand, WordPress.com has certain limitations. You can’t install all WordPress themes and plugins on the site. Moreover, you should stick to the default WordPress.com hosting. Regular hosting companies don’t support to create and manage websites with WordPress.com. 
How good is HostArmada?HostArmada is a fast and affordable cloud web hosting solution. They have cloud shared, cloud WordPress, cloud reseller, cloud VPS, and dedicated hosting plans. Generally, cloud web hosting is expensive. But HostArmada provides it at reasonable rates. Their pricing starts at as low as $2.49/mo with a free domain, free SSL, daily backups, and free malware scan and removal. It is a good choice for businesses, blogs, online shops, and agencies to run websites in a high-performance environment. 
Where is HostArmada based?HostArmada is located in Wilmington, Delaware, United States. But they have servers across the globe to handle all your customers without any performance fluctuations. 
Which hosting is better than GoDaddy?GoDaddy hosting has a low online reputation. It may be good for domain registration, but not for hosting. HostArmada is a great alternative to GoDaddy. It is cheap and reliable. All our main websites hosted with them since 2020. HostArmada has a 45-days money-back guarantee. So there is no risk in trying their service. If you are not satisfied with your hosting experience, contact HostArmada support and raise your refund request. You will get the full amount back. 
Which is the best alternative to HostGator?HostArmada. It is fast, secure, and budget-friendly. They provide all essential hosting features in the basic plan itself. Free domain, free SSL, free migration, daily backups, free malware scan, and unlimited email accounts are some features of HostArmada’s basic shared hosting ($2.49/mo) plan. 
Is HostArmada hosting worth it?Yes, HostArmada hosting worth your money. They host websites in a managed hosting environment. It means that they handle everything such as security, performance, backup, and others on behalf of you. No need to install complex security programs or premium caching solutions. HostArmada monitors security events in real-time and manage caching via server-level configurations. They also run daily backups and store your data safely in the cloud server. So you can focus on productive tasks rather than spending much time on maintenance and security. 
What’s the cheapest website host?Don’t choose a hosting company based on cost alone. Also see if the service they provide is good and if the existing customers are satisfied with them.Based on my experience and overall user reviews, I suggest you to go with HostArmada. It is cheap, secure, and fast. Their pricing starts at just $2.99/mo with cloud SSD storage and other premium-quality benefits. You may find some hosting services that offer hosting for less than or around $1/mo. But they lack many essential features, and you should pay extra to add those things. You are going to buy hosting to build a money making website. Not for a time pass. So never compromise on the hosting quality and features. 
Can I host my website for free?Yes, there are some free web hosting services available to host your websites for free. But you can’t expect premium quality hosting experience there. It is always better to go with a budget-friendly web host like HostArmada or GreenGeeks. They are the cheapest hosting providers with outstanding service and support. 
Which is the fastest hosting server?Kinsta is a premium WordPress hosting service for large scale businesses and enterprises. They serve content faster with highly optimized servers, Key CDN integration, and other growth hacking features. Starting at $35/mo, it is a perfect choice for top-tier websites. For small, medium-scale businesses, and blogs, HostArmada is the right choice. It hosts websites on cloud SSD servers with LiteSpeed caching, and other performance-oriented features. Their cloud shared hosting plans start at $2.49 per month and cloud VPS hosting plans start at $41.21 per month. Kinsta is a managed WordPress host, optimized for running WordPress websites only. But on HostArmada, you can host all types of websites.
