ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Muhammad Sami Saeed on Tuesday gave directives to accelerate the pace of work on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects in Gwadar.
Chairing a meeting to review the progress on CPEC projects in Gwadar, he asked ministries and divisions to speed up work on the projects, according to a press statement.
Representatives of ministries and divisions gave a detailed briefing on the implementation of projects in Gwadar.
The minister noted that all major projects including the Gwadar power plant, distribution of 2,000 boat engines to fishermen, Khuzdar-Panjgur transmission line (via Nag-Basima) which connects Markran with national grid, New Gwadar International Airport, China-Pak Friendship Hospital, China-Pak Technical and Vocational Institute, Gwadar Eastbay Expressway Project, Gwadar Free Zone and Gwadar Port would become a shining pearl in the region.
 He asserted that the interim government was committed to implementing the CPEC projects to make it a success.
In the recent budget, the allocation for Balochistan had been doubled which indicated that the federal government was committed to uplifting the province.
Several projects had been completed in Balochistan that were related to education, healthcare and social sectors to facilitate the people, said the minister while reiterating that the government would continue its efforts to further support the province.
Officials of the interior ministry gave a detailed briefing on the security measures taken for Chinese officials working in Pakistan.
