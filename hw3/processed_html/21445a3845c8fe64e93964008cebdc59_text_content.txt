Chart of all Rifle Calibers In Order, And Their Power

If you‚Äôre just getting started in learning about firearms, it can be really complicated to understand all the different calibers and what each cartridge is capable of.  Let‚Äôs begin with understanding what caliber actually means.
‚ÄúCaliber‚Äù is a measurement in inches of the internal width of a firearm‚Äôs barrel, and consequently the width of the bullet.  A larger caliber such as .308‚Ä≥ means the bullet is physically wider than a bullet such as a .22‚Ä≥.  Larger caliber bullets can cause more damage and generally weigh more; however, caliber only describes the bullet size but provides no information as to the cartridge‚Äôs speed or power.  
Next, we need to understand what exactly a ‚Äúcartridge‚Äù is, and how that differs from a bullet.  A ‚ÄúCartridge‚Äù refers to the entire firing unit: brass case, primer, gun powder, and projectile.  The word ‚Äúbullet‚Äù only refers to the action projectile that is shot through the barrel and hits the target.  
Now that you understand that, things will start to make sense.  Let‚Äôs take an example.  The .308 Winchester and the .300 PRC are both the exact same caliber.  They both shoot a .308 caliber bullet.  Don‚Äôt be confused by the names of cartridges.  Sometimes they round things off to make a nice marketing name (such as the .300 PRC when it‚Äôs really a .308) and sometimes they use other ways to measure so they can have a nice-sounding name.
Both the .308 and the .300 PRC can shoot the exact same bullet (projectile).  For example, a 180-grain GMX bullet could be loaded and fired out of either cartridge.  Bullet designs are mostly interchangeable between cartridges of the same caliber.
However, the .308 Winchester case is much smaller than the case of a .300 PRC.  Thus, the .308 Winchester case can‚Äôt hold as much gun powder, so when it shoots the projectile, it won‚Äôt cause as much damage to the target.
Now you‚Äôre ready to see some numbers.  On this chart, you‚Äôll see the name of the cartridge, the caliber measurement for that cartridge, then an approximation of how big of an animal that cartridge could kill (much of which is highly debatable), and how much average energy the cartridge would produce at a typical hunting distance of 100 yards.

For many of you, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for.  You want to know how powerful each cartridge is.  But if you‚Äôre also looking for a conversion of caliber in inches to mm, the following chart should have what you‚Äôre looking for.
