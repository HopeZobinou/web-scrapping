SEO Area Importance vs Website Size: Some time ago the awesome Mark Williams-Cook shared a brilliantly simple but easy to understand chart as one of his unsolicited SEO tips (which you can see here: https://lnkd.in/dsdFWfTJ) where he showed how the biggest the site, the most important technical issues/opportunities tend to be, and how content is more important for smaller sites. 

I've used this graph as a base to integrate another critical area: backlinks; as well as to add nuance to the content aspect: 

1. Add another important area of SEO work: Backlinks. Which also (in most cases, although there might be exceptions) become less of an issue the biggest the size of the site, as they tend to be more authoritative and established, with more content attracting backlinks naturally too. 

2. I've also added a bit of "nuance" to the content line: The relative importance/value of content will tend to decrease the biggest the site is, however, it won't lose its value so quickly, it will hold its importance up to a point, even from a "maintenance" standpoint to keep info up to date, show accurate info, and give good user experience beyond search, so I've changed the chart to reflect this. 

I hope you like it and find useful to show the value of different areas to clients/stakeholders 👇

Am not quite sure why the backlinks graph is as such...I would have thought big websites need backlinks from PR/social media/etc as much as small websites (or how else would their credibility be established?)

Brand Entity is the defining factor. That's why the backlinks don't matter. "URLS that are more POPULAR on the Internet tend to be crawled more often to keep them fresher in our index. " - Google 2017 . fwiw.. popular ≠ backlinks.

The chart is kinda silly. Why not just say "Its more likely that big sites can benefit from technical SEO"?

My "Tip": Measure your sites vs competition and then decide what is important. 

Deciding what is important for a site simply based on its size is actually ridiculous. While it is more LIKELY that technical will have bigger impact for very large sites, all the conclusions from the chart do not follow. 

Sites don't live in a vacuum, and every signal is relative, especially in the zero sum game of ranking. 

All big sites don't just have better link graphs than their competitors. Even if they did, why would links become less important?

What about the sophistication of the operation? What if they are already strong technically? How does technical become more important as the site get larger? 

Content may be the best way to expand from a solid foundation. Why does content keep getting less important?

With all respect to how vivid this graph is, I strongly disagree that backlinks become less important for large sites.

A large site with zero incoming links can be not indexed for months. No indexing = no rankings =  no visitors = no natural links.

Even large websites that already have tremendous link profiles also rely on backlinks and if they neglect this, in 5-10 years they will be outperformed.

I like the update you've made and agree with the change. I do think it's important to point out this is relative to the quality of each of these and it isn't an absolute matter of fact. This is to say, out of 100 enterprise sites, the majority of sites' value to be unlocked via resolving technical issues but isn't always the case. 

Similarly, if a large site has an authority in a specific space but the business wants to expand into a related area of expertise, the business might actually have expert individuals, teams, IP that lives offline but because the site's online signals haven't historically reflected this due to lack of love or whatever the reason, there's a need to garner back links from sites in that new space. But like you mentioned, this might not be as important as building content around in-house expert authors.

Aleyda Solís really nice graph, now the "content blue curve" is an interesting one, of course when the site is really small, if you don't invest in great content you have nothing to show ; but on the other hand even with a really big sites you may have to invest in content to enhance indexation, or for HCU purposes, or simply because you'd like to take over new territories. I guess content becomes central to any SEO strategy nowadays, isn't it ?

E-commerce struggling w/ PDPs indexability? Give more reasons to index besides XML sitemaps inclusion: 

* Unique title, meta description, headings, main description featuring specific characteristics 

* Feature more indexable reviews (don’t lazy load them all) and Q&As  

* More crawlable & optimized internal links w descriptive anchor texts cross-linking similar PDPs, facets to PDPs, brand pages to PDPs, guides to PDPs. The compounding effect is 🔥

* Indexable Product and Reviews Structured Data inclusion without errors. 

Align those signals!

Today, I attended Google Search Central in Zürich. 
7 talks - 7 take-aways.

• Google Shopping: "Two third of user don’t buy from Merchants they don’t know." Matthias Wiesmann, Google

• Luxury brands: Most luxury homepages are image-led. You need to get the basics right, such as metas, schema, descriptive URLs, and alt tags. Also, focus on Digital PR. (Maria Amelie White, your creativity to work on SEO without text is so impressive.) Maria White, Kurt Geiger

• Search news: "Who knows, maybe there will be more algorithm updates soon.” (We leave it with that.) John Müller, Google

• SafeSearch: Google is now blurring explicit content in image search. This is a default setting in your account. Pierre Inzerillo & Christin von Essen, Google

• The four horror stories of SEOs in 2023: SGE, Core Updates, wrong configurations which affect crawling and indexing, lack of SEO validation of Web migrations. (Thank you Aleyda Solís for featuring my horror story when I unintendedly crashed Ofri.ch's blog.) Aleyda Solis, Orianti

• Structured data: Although HowTo and FAQ structured data results have been removed from SERP, you don't need to remove the structured data itself from your pages." Ryan Levering, Google

• Cookieless future: Chrome plans to disable third-party cookies for 1% of users from Q1 2024. Andrey Lipattsev, Google.

From the series "Tell me you're a freelance or biz owner since a while ago without telling me..." : As part of the process to register me as a guest lecturer at a University, I've been asked for my CV. What's that?! 😂 I haven't done one since 10 yrs ago or so! 

PS: I've sent the Bio page of my site instead 😅

Hit by Google's Helpful Content Update?

Correlation isn't causation, but ~80% of sites that reached out to me publicly/privately after being hit by Google's HCU update had one common denominator

All ran Mediavine, Adthrive, etc, with ads that follow user scroll and cover the main content.

Auto-play videos, social share popups, full-page interstitials, and alert buttons were too common.

It wasn't simply a Google content update. It was a UX update too
