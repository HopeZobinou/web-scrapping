The Struggle of Reaching 100 Followers on Medium | by Yvonne Laframboise | How To Increase Your Followers Number | MediumMember-only storyThe Struggle of Reaching 100 Followers on MediumWhy it is so difficult for beginners and some tips to get there quicklyYvonne Laframboise·FollowPublished inHow To Increase Your Followers Number·4 min read·Mar 2--18SharePhoto by NordWood Themes on UnsplashReaching 100 Followers at Your Own SpeedPhoto by Luis Morera on UnsplashJust recently, I finally reached the goal of 100 followers!!Thank you to everyone, who contributed to this journey!Starting from having absolutely no audience, it was a slow but steady climb. However, it was not at all an easy journey. I’ve read many articles on people reaching 100 followers super quickly, such as “in under 36 hours”, but also others, who took much longer to reach that goal.I started writing on Medium in mid-February, so it’s been a bit more than two weeks now. Because I’m also a full-time medical student and just started my semester abroad, I was only able to publish two articles in this time. (Don’t worry, there are more to come!)The reason I started writing on Medium was that for one, I love writing. I’ve always been passionate about writing down things. In school, I was much better at writing essays than doing presentations. When I was in the hospital a few weeks ago (click here to read that story), it was a very difficult time for me. I was emotionally unstable and what helped me process my feelings at that time, was to write about what I was going through.In addition to that, I’ve been wanting to be more financially independent for a long while. I have tried lots of different things, but they all didn’t work out. So here I am, giving it a try on Medium. I know that most writers really don’t earn a lot, but I’m willing to give it a try.Everyone takes a different time to reach a certain goal. Don’t be discouraged by others quickly reaching their goal in a few hours, whilst you’ve been working on it for much longer.Consistency is KeyPhoto by Paico Oficial on Unsplash----18FollowWritten by Yvonne Laframboise478 Followers·Writer for How To Increase Your Followers NumberMedical student - loving to write about medical stuff, travel and life .
