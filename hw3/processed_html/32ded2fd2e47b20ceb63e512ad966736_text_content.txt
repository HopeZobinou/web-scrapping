    President Joe Biden has taken a tumble numerous times â€“ including falling while climbing the ramp to Air Force One and while navigating the stage at a military awards ceremony. As expected, his critics were always on hand to poke fun at the President and suggest his tumbles are due to his advancing age. Now, one of those who mocked Biden's unsure footedness took a tumble himself, Newsweek reported.Video captured Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) slipping down a row of steps while exiting an airplane Wednesday. The footage immediately began to circulate Twitter, with people mocking him with names like, "Tommy Tumbleville."POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?"Queen Karma paid Tommy Tuberville a visit. Stay as long as you like, ma'am. ðŸ¤£," Democratic influencer Brooklyn Dad posted on X.In July, Tuberville told reporters that he expects Biden to fall every time he appears in public."You watch Joe Biden over in Europe. I mean, I'm afraid he's going to fall down every time I turn on television," Tuberville said at the time. X users were quick to point out what they say is Tuberville's hypocrisy.
