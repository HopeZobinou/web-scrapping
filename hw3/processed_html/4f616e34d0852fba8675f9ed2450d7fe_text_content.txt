US President Joe Biden has made a resolute commitment to reinforce military support for Israel in the wake of a relentless assault by Hamas militants. This attack, which has resulted in the tragic loss of over 1,000 Israeli lives, has spurred a fierce response against the Gaza Strip, currently under Palestinian control.
President Biden's unwavering pledge to bolster Israel's military capabilities has sparked concerns about the feasibility of providing defense aid to Israel without undermining crucial assistance to Ukraine. These concerns have intensified due to the recent ousting of House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy by Republican lawmakers, who are yet to designate a replacement.


While the Biden administration asserts that the United States can indeed support both nations simultaneously, they acknowledge that there will be formidable challenges ahead.
The Absence of a House Speaker and Its Implications
The U.S. Congress holds the purse strings, making it imperative for President Biden to secure the approval of both the Senate and the House for additional funding. Typically, spending bills originate in the House, where the Speaker, the elected leader of the majority party, wields considerable influence over which legislation reaches the voting floor.
With Republicans maintaining a narrow 221-212 majority in the House, it became possible for a small faction of their members to unseat Speaker McCarthy, marking an unprecedented event in American history. Given the extraordinary circumstances surrounding McCarthy's removal, there is uncertainty about whether Representative Patrick McHenry, currently serving as the temporary speaker, possesses the legal authority to call for a vote on any aid-related legislation.
Complicating matters further is the fact that many of the far-right members responsible for McCarthy's ousting are staunchly opposed to providing aid to Ukraine. Notably, Representative Jim Jordan, a prominent contender in the Speaker's race, is among those opposing such assistance. House Republicans recently declined to include aid for Ukraine in a last-minute spending bill passed last month, aimed at averting a government shutdown.
The Dilemma of Overlapping Needs
The dilemma at hand revolves around how much the needs of Israel and Ukraine coincide. Israel has long been a significant recipient of U.S. military support and maintains a consistent flow of American aid. In 2016, both nations entered into a 10-year agreement encompassing $38 billion in annual grants for military equipment procurement and an additional $5 billion allocated for missile defense.
In the current phase of the conflict, Israel primarily requires small arms for its infantry and air defense interceptors to safeguard civilian infrastructure and military command centers. It is improbable that Israel has depleted its small arms ammunition reserves so early in the conflict. Regarding missile defense, Israel employs the Iron Dome system, developed with substantial U.S. backing, which offers air defense capabilities distinct from the U.S.-made Patriot system and other missile defense systems deployed in Ukraine.
In contrast, Ukraine's immediate needs consist of ammunition, missile defense systems, and ground vehicles as it strives to reclaim territory from Russian invaders who initiated their offensive in February 2022. Since the inception of the invasion, the United States has allocated $44 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, with several tranches of aid approved by Congress, the latest of which received approval in December 2022.
Both Israel and Ukraine, alongside other recipients of U.S. weapon aid like Taiwan, would benefit from Congress authorizing funding to augment the permanent manufacturing capacity of American defense contractors. This would address concerns that the shipment of U.S. weapons overseas may deplete domestic stockpiles, potentially posing a risk to national security.
