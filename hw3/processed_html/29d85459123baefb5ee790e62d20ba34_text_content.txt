A Starbucks labor union with past ties to prominent members of the Democratic Party expressed “solidarity” with the people group that backed an unprecedented terrorist attack on Israel.A social media account for Starbucks Workers United posted “Solidarity with Palestine!” following the deadliest terror attack on Israeli soil in the nation’s history, according to The Washington Free Beacon. The attack was carried out by Hamas, an Iran-backed terror group elected to lead Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The attack left over 1,200 civilians dead and thousands wounded, marking the deadliest single day for Jews since the Holocaust.The union has since deleted the post, made on X, formerly known as Twitter, according to the Free Beacon, which captured a screenshot of the image. Starbucks Workers United is an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and represents roughly 9,000 baristas.The now-erased comment was made while reposting an image of a Palestinian bulldozer tearing down the Israeli-constructed wall between Gaza and Israel. The Hamas attack against Israel, which took place Saturday, included hundreds of terrorists who tore apart sections of the wall to transport vehicles, weapons, and militants into Israel.In the recent past, a number of prominent Democrats have aligned themselves with the union, such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman.Support for Palestinians has gained traction on the left-wing of the Democratic Party and in institutions such as Harvard since Israel declared war on Hamas on Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to repay Hamas for butchering hundreds of Israeli civilians with a war that the terrorists and their backers will remember for decades.Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Cori Bush of Missouri put out statements criticizing Israel in the aftermath of the attack and expressing support for Palestinians. Tlaib, in a lengthy statement, falsely accused Israel of being an apartheid state and of occupying Palestinian territory. She then called for U.S. funding to Israel to be cut.CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILY WIRE APP“The failure to recognize the violent reality of living under siege, occupation, and apartheid makes no one safer. No person, no child anywhere should have to suffer or live in fear of violence. We cannot ignore the humanity in each other,” she said. “As long as our country provides billions in unconditional funding to support the apartheid government, this heartbreaking cycle of violence will continue.”Bush made a similar statement, also calling for the U.S. to pull support for the Jewish state: “As part of achieving a just and lasting peace, we must do our part to stop this violence and trauma by ending U.S. government support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.”Daily Wire Editor Emeritus Ben Shapiro debunked the accusations against Israel during an interview with Megyn Kelly on her show Tuesday.“Israel unilaterally pulled out of the Gaza Strip in an attempt to create some sort of security arrangement, presumably protect the Jews at the northern tip of the Gaza Strip, and allow the Palestinians some chance at electing a government,” Shapiro said, referring to the pullout in 2005. “They then promptly elected Hamas, a State Department-designated terror group in an election that was fully legitimate as attested to by [former U.S. President] Jimmy Carter.”“So the attempt to tie this to settlements is insane,” Shapiro said, “because again, there are no settlements inside the Gaza Strip. The areas that were attacked [in Israel] have been part of the state of Israel since 1948. This is not post-1967 settlements in the West Bank — in the so-called West Bank; Judea and Samaria.”The Daily Wire   >  Read   >  Starbucks Union Backed By Prominent Dems Claims ‘Solidarity With Palestine’ After Hamas Terror AttackAboutAuthorsAdvertise With UsBook our SpeakersDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationLegalSupportStandards & PoliciesShipping & ReturnsCareersMedia & Press InquiriesFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeRSS© Copyright 2023, The Daily Wire LLC | Terms | Privacy
