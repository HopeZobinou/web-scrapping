Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed Tuesday the ongoing, violent conflict between Israel and Hamas following a series of terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas.    Putin made the remarks in a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani, according to The Moscow Times."I think many will agree with me that this is a clear example of the failure of U.S. policy in the Middle East," Putin said at the meeting.

Thousands more have been wounded, and many others have been taken hostage by Hamas and raped, tortured and murdered.  Putin blamed the Hamas terror attacks on U.S. interventionism, claiming the U.S. military regulated and managed tensions between the two territories without concern for the long-term wishes of Palestinians."[Washington] tried to monopolize regulating [the conflict], but was unfortunately unconcerned with finding compromises acceptable for both sides," the Russian president said of the violence.   NORTH KOREA-RUSSIA BORDER RAIL TRAFFIC SURGING WITH UNKNOWN CARGO, SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS  Russian President Vladimir Putin before a meeting with the Iraqi prime minister at the Kremlin in Moscow on Oct. 10, 2023.

Each time, however, without taking into account the fundamental interests of the Palestinian people."   Israel fired artillery into Lebanese territory Wednesday after the Islamist group Hezbollah claimed responsibility for an anti-tank guided missile attack on an Israeli army post on the Lebanon border.     Hezbollah said it had fired precision missiles at an Israeli position in response to the killing of its members in Israeli shelling earlier this week, pledging "decisive" responses to attacks on Lebanese territory, especially deadly ones. The group claimed the attack caused a "large number" of casualties but did not give specifics.   Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani at the Kremlin on Oct. 10, 2023.

Terrorists gunned down hundreds of Israelis, invaded homes and slaughtered those they found, and took an estimated 150 people captive.   Timothy Nerozzi is a writer for Fox News Digital.
