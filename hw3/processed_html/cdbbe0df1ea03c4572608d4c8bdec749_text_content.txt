Latest SeedProd NewsWordPress Tutorials, Tips, and Resources to Help Grow Your Business  7 Best WordPress Page Builders with Drag-and-Drop (for 2023) October 20, 2023-Stacey Corrin
Ever felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of plugins claiming to be the best WordPress page builders out there? You’re not alone. 
Choosing the right page builder can make or break your website’s functionality and design. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll cut through the noise and show you the best WordPress page builders that are worth your time and money.
What Is a WordPress Page Builder?
WordPress page builders are tools that allow users to create and customize the layout and design of their WordPress website without having to write any code. They typically provide a drag-and-drop interface that makes it easy to add, rearrange, and style page elements such as text, images, and buttons.
Some page builders also offer pre-designed templates and widgets, which can be used to create complex layouts and add features like forms, maps, and social media feeds to a website.
Many page builders are available as plugins that can be installed on a WordPress website, while others are built into the WordPress theme itself.

Why Choosing the Right WordPress Page Builder Matters
There are several reasons why website owners might consider using a drag-and-drop page builder:

Ease of use: Page builders are designed to be user-friendly, even for those who have little or no coding experience. This makes it easy for website owners to create and customize their own layouts and designs rather than having to hire a developer to do it for them.
Customization: Page builders offer a wide range of customization options, allowing website owners to create a unique look and feel for their site. This can be especially important for businesses that want to stand out from the competition.
Time-saving: Page builders can save website owners a lot of time, as they allow users to quickly create and edit pages without having to write code. This can be especially useful for those who need to make frequent updates to their sites.
Responsive design: Most page builders are designed to create responsive websites, which means that they will look and function properly on a wide range of devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. This is important in today’s world, where more and more people are using mobile devices to access the web.
Cost-effective: Page builders can be a cost-effective solution for small businesses and other organizations that need to create a professional-looking website but don’t have the budget to hire a developer. Many page builders offer a variety of pricing plans, including free and paid options.

So how about we dive in and discover what to look for in a great drag-and-drop WordPress page builder?

The plugin offers an extensive library of over 352 pre-configured layouts, catering to various needs like homepages, sales funnels, webinars, and lead generation, among others.

Getting started is a breeze, thanks to its intuitive onboarding tour that helps you easily navigate the platform.
The plugin features a real-time drag-and-drop interface, allowing you to see changes instantly as you drag elements from the sidebar and place them onto your page. Simply click on any element to tweak its settings.
Beaver Builder offers a variety of modules that enable you to add just about anything—think sliders, carousels, custom backgrounds, buttons, and a plethora of content blocks.
Additionally, it provides a selection of over 30 professionally crafted landing page templates, streamlining the process of creating visually appealing website layouts.

4. Divi by Elegant Themes
Best WordPress Theme with Page Builder

Divi is both a sophisticated drag-and-drop theme and a WordPress page builder plugin. Its user-friendly interface is complemented by a large selection of layout packs tailored for various website types.
Much like SeedProd and Beaver Builder, Divi features a genuine WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) visual editor, complete with drag-and-drop.
The real-time editing feature allows you to make changes directly on your page, offering a live preview without the need to save and click ‘preview’ to see updates.
Divi has a wide array of content modules that can be easily dragged and dropped into your layout. These modules can be organized in various sections and rows, each with its own set of advanced customization options.
Creating custom layouts is a breeze with Divi. You can save these layouts for future use or even export them to another Divi installation.
Although the Divi Builder plugin is integral to the Divi theme, it’s also compatible with other popular WordPress themes.
One of Divi’s standout features is its cost-effective pricing. A single payment grants you access to the Divi theme, the Divi Builder plugin, and all other Elegant Themes offerings, like Extra and Bloom.
This flexibility allows you to either use the Divi theme or integrate the Divi Builder plugin with any other theme.
Pricing: Starts at $89 per year.
Our Rating: A
Why We Recommend It: Divi is a compelling alternative to SeedProd, offering a robust page builder that opens the door to endless design options. With its extensive array of content modules, you can craft virtually any kind of website you desire. The availability of a lifetime plan further cements its position as one of the market’s most cost-effective choices.
5. Elementor
Best WordPress Page Builder with Popups

Elementor Pro is another robust drag-and-drop page builder for WordPress, featuring a live editing interface that allows you to see changes in real time as you make them.
Begin by crafting sections and choosing the column layout for each. Widgets can then be effortlessly dragged from the sidebar panel into your designated sections.
Elementor offers a rich selection of widgets, covering everything from basic text and images to advanced elements like accordions, sliders, testimonials, and social media icons, among others.
Each widget operates independently and comes with its own set of customization options. Plus, Elementor is flexible enough to incorporate widgets from other WordPress plugins.
If you’d rather not start from scratch, Elementor provides a variety of pre-designed templates. These can be inserted into your pages with ease. A simple point-and-click interface lets you edit any element, swap out content, and voila—you’re all set.
Pricing: Starts at $49 per year.
Our Rating: A
Why We Recommend It: Elementor enjoys widespread popularity as a WordPress page builder plugin thanks to its user-friendly interface, expansive extensions ecosystem, and a wealth of modules and templates for custom website building. However, it’s worth noting that the plugin’s code output could be more efficient, as users frequently report experiencing slower page speeds.
You can check out our detailed Elementor review and tutorial for more information.
6. Visual Composer
Best WordPress Page Builder for Front and Backend Editing

Visual Composer Website Builder is a comprehensive tool for crafting custom WordPress websites quickly and effortlessly.
Featuring a straightforward drag-and-drop interface, a wealth of content elements, and professionally designed templates, this plugin packs a punch when it comes to website creation.
Like SeedProd and Beaver Builder, Visual Composer offers a genuine front-end editing experience. But it takes things a step further by allowing you to modify every facet of your landing page, including logos, menus, headers, footers, and sidebars. This all-encompassing approach is why it’s dubbed a ‘website builder‘ rather than just a ‘page builder.’
The plugin comes loaded with robust design options, letting you customize each element’s appearance. You can easily incorporate dynamic backgrounds like parallax, gradients, slideshows, carousels, and even videos. Plus, it offers the flexibility of adjustable rows and columns for grid layouts.
Compatibility is a non-issue with Visual Composer, as it works seamlessly with all WordPress themes. This means you can switch themes without losing any custom layouts you’ve created.
Additional features include Gutenberg editor support, Google Fonts integration, and Yoast SEO compatibility.
Our Rating: A-
Why We Recommend It: Visual Composer is an excellent starting point for beginners looking to build a website, offering robust features in an uncomplicated format. Its real front-end drag-and-drop editor simplifies the website editing process. However, its interface deviates from the standard WordPress plugin layout, which can be disorienting for newcomers.
Pricing: Starts at $49 per year.
7. Themify Builder
Best Free WordPress Page Builder

Themify Builder is a free WordPress page builder plugin. Created by Themify, you can use it to build simple website pages quickly.
With Themify Builder, you’re not just limited to basic page building. The plugin offers an expansive library of over 60 pre-designed animation effects and layouts, making it a breeze to design pages that capture attention. If you find that a layout isn’t quite hitting the mark, you have the freedom to undo or redo changes until you’re completely satisfied.
One of the standout features is the ability to copy modules to other pages, allowing you to efficiently reuse elements across your website.
For those looking to add a geographical touch to their site, the Maps Pro addon lets you integrate a variety of map styles. And if you’re in the market for even more functionality, Themify Builder offers an additional suite of over 25 addons, including options like Slider Pro, Bar Chart, and Contact, to name a few.
Our Rating: A-
Why We Recommend It: The plugin offers a straightforward approach to building pages, complete with a variety of pre-designed layouts and animation effects. While it’s user-friendly enough for beginners, it also offers an addon bundle for more advanced features, making it versatile for all skill levels. However, if you’re accustomed to the standard WordPress interface, Themify’s unique layout might take a bit of getting used to.
Pricing: Starts at $59 per year.
