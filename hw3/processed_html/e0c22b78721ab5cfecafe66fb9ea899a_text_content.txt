From the iconic Nyan Cat to the innovative Mfpurrs and the groundbreaking Prowling Purrs, this article delves into the evolutionary journey of these digital art movements.Nyan Cat: A Whimsical BeginningOn April 2, 2011, a quirky GIF animation featuring a cat with a Pop-Tart body emerged, created by Christopher Torres, also known as “prguitarman.” Nyan Cat quickly became an internet sensation, with its catchy tune and charmingly absurd premise. The initial animation, which combined a “Pop-Tart” and a “cat,” eventually evolved into the animated GIF we all know and love. The song “Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya!” featuring Hatsune Miku provided the perfect soundtrack to this feline journey.The Nyan Cat story took an unexpected turn when, in February 2021, the original GIF’s creator, Chris Torres, sold an updated version as a non-fungible token (NFT) for a substantial sum, highlighting the ever-growing interest in the digital art world.Mfpurrs: The Pixel Art RevolutionMfpurrs emerged as a unique blend of crypto, creativity, and cats. These 10,000 original pixel art cats, known as “Ethscriptions,” found their place on the Ethereum blockchain. What started with a simple act of uploading a cat jpeg onto Ethereum turned into a pixel art revolution.Mfpurrs became a canvas for pixel art, with talented artists collaborating to craft the collection’s base model. Unique traits, including Gold furs, Black and White furs, and a playful nod to web3's culture, added depth to this digital menagerie. Mfpurrs’ open-source philosophy and the ability to permanently name them on Ethereum made them a dynamic part of the blockchain community.----FollowWritten by Ron Hale2 Followers·Editor for CoinscriptionCoinscription is a ethscription & crypto media platform.FollowMore from Ron Hale and CoinscriptionRon HaleinCoinscriptionNerdy Revolutionethscription project launching soon. ·3 min read·Oct 8--2Ron HaleinCoinscriptionDumbSwap: A New Era·3 min read·Oct 6--Ron HaleinCoinscriptionInsights from the Chris & Jeni Twitter Ethscription Space·4 min read·Oct 7--1Ron HaleinCoinscriptionA Call for Community-Centered GrowthHeart & Soul of ethscriptions·3 min read·Oct 14--See all from Ron HaleSee all from CoinscriptionRecommended from MediumPaul RoseI Found A Very Profitable AI Side HustleAnd it’s perfect for beginners6 min read·6 days ago--52AL AnanyThe ChatGPT Hype Is Over — Now Watch How Google Will Kill ChatGPT.It never happens instantly.
