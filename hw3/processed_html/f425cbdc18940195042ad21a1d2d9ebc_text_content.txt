Ophthalmic manifestations and tissue tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the pathology and cellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 are not well characterized. The objective of this study was to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic changes and investigate cellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 across ocular tissues at autopsy. Ocular tissues were obtained from 25 patients with COVID-19 at autopsy. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene RNA was previously quantified by droplet digital PCR from one eye. Herein, contralateral eyes from 21 patients were fixed in formalin and subject to histopathologic examination. Sections of the droplet digital PCRâ€“positive eyes from four other patients were evaluated by in situ hybridization to determine the cellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene RNA. Histopathologic abnormalities, including cytoid bodies, vascular changes, and retinal edema, with minimal or no inflammation in ocular tissues were observed in all 21 cases evaluated. In situ hybridization localized SARS-CoV-2 RNA to neuronal cells of the retinal inner and outer layers, ganglion cells, corneal epithelia, scleral fibroblasts, and oligodendrocytes of the optic nerve. In conclusion, a range of common histopathologic alterations were identified within ocular tissue, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was localized to multiple cell types. Further studies will be required to determine whether the alterations observed were caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host immune response, and/or preexisting comorbidities.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects tissues throughout the human body, including ocular tissues and fluids.1Stein S.R.

Specifically, N RNA was detected in the cornea [8 of 19 (42%)], choroid/sclera [16 of 32 (50%)], lens [10 of 19 (53%)], retina [6 of 17 (35%)], optic nerve [17 of 29 (59%)], vitreous humor [5 of 35 (14%)], and aqueous humor [8 of 32 (25%)]. The copies of N RNA were lower overall in ocular tissues from individuals with longer disease duration and persisted for months in several tissue types. ddPCR-positive tissues and ocular fluids were also assayed for subgenomic RNA, a marker of recent viral replication. Subgenomic RNA was detected in ocular tissues of 7 of 22 cases tested (32%), including in the choroid/sclera of a patient who died 99 days into illness.1Stein S.R. Ramelli S.C. Grazioli A.

SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistence throughout the human body and brain.Nature. 2022; 612: 758-763Google Scholar For the study described here, the contralateral eye from E1 to E21 was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 72 hours with the globe intact, opened for macroscopic examination, and then embedded in paraffin for histopathologic evaluation. For cellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, one eye from E22 to E25 was dissected to isolate cornea, retina, choroid/sclera, and optic nerve. Each tissue type was divided into two piecesâ€”one for ISH and one for SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR. The piece prepared for ISH was fixed for 24 hours in neutral buffered formalin because prolonged formalin fixation interfered with RNA preservation. This fixed piece was then transferred to 70% ethanol for a minimum of 2 days before impregnation with paraffin. The piece prepared for ddPCR was placed in RNA later media for nucleic acid preservation and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification was used to guide selection of tissues for analysis by ISH.HistopathologyEach eye was cut horizontally along the pupillary-optic nerve head (P-O) axis. For other lesions outside the P-O section, a segment through the lesion was also obtained for histologic analysis. After macroscopic examination of the open eye under a stereo dissecting microscope, all P-O sections and segments were then processed for routine paraffin embedding and sectioning. Consecutive sections of 4-Î¼m thickness were sliced from each paraffin block and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acidâ€“Schiff reagent.ImmunohistochemistryCD61, a marker of platelet aggregation and thrombosis, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) expressions were evaluated on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides using immunohistochemistry. Briefly, the presence of CD61 was detected by immunohistochemistry performed on FFPE sections with an anti-CD61 mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 2f2; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) performed on a Roche Discovery Ultra instrument with 3,3â€²-diaminobenzidine detection per clinical laboratory protocol. The presence of CMV was also detected by a similar method with an anti-CMV antibody (clone CCH2+DDG9; Agilent Dako, Santa Clara, CA).SARS-CoV-2 Spike RNA ISHISH was performed using manual RNAscope 2.5 HD Reagent Kit-BROWN (catalog number 322350; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) according to the user manual (322360-USM) and as previously described.1Stein S.R.

For each ocular tissue, RNAscope Probe-V-nCoV2019-S (catalog number 848561; Advanced Cell Diagnostics), RNAscope Positive Control Probe-Hs-PPIB (catalog number 313901; Advanced Cell Diagnostics), and RNAscope Negative Control Probe-DapB (catalog number 310043; Advanced Cell Diagnostics) were applied to three sequential slides and incubated at 40Â°C for 2 hours. After rinsing, the ISH signal was amplified using six amplifiers and incubated with a diaminobenzidine substrate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Slides were then counterstained with 50% hematoxylin, air-dried, and mounted.ResultsAutopsy Cohort OverviewPostmortem ocular specimens were collected from 25 cases (E1 to E25) with confirmed COVID-19 between April 2020 and December 2021. E24 was the only case that received a COVID-19 vaccine. Eight of the 25 cases (32%) were female, and the mean age at the time of death was 58 years (range, 6 to 91 years). Twenty-four of the 25 (96%) cases had at least one comorbidity, and 15 (60%) cases had three or more comorbidities, with hypertension [15 (60%)] and obesity [10 (40%)] being the most common. The median interval from symptom onset to death was 18 days (range, 4 to 204 days), and the median interval between death and autopsy was 23 hours (range, 10 to 106 hours). Systemic steroids and systemic anticoagulation were commonly administered to treat COVID-19. Case-by-case demographic and clinical data can be found in Supplemental Table S1.Macroscopic Retinal LesionsPathologic findings (E1 to E21) are described in Supplemental Table S2 alongside previously reported SARS-CoV-2 RNA ddPCR results from contralateral ocular tissues of the same case.1Stein S.R.

Specifically, one eye (E18) had vascular sheathing similar to vasculitis in multiple branch retinal vessels (FigureÂ 1A). Two eyes (E2 and E11) showed focal whitish cotton-wool spots in the posterior pole (FigureÂ 1B). Two eyes had focal retinal hemorrhages in the posterior pole (E8 and E17) and midperipheral retina (E8) (FigureÂ 1C). One eye (E19) showed several patches of subretinal whitish infiltrates (FigureÂ 1D). Microscopic examination showed the whitish infiltrates being severe retinal edema and disorganization, accumulation of serous fluids in the retinal outer plexiform layer, as well as debris and strands in the vitreous (FigureÂ 1D, inset). In terms of lesions not associated with COVID-19, four eyes (E3, E7, E13, and E17) were pseudophakic with residual cortex material in the peripheral capsule; E3 also showed two old, large hypopigmented chorioretinal scars with focal hyperpigmentation in the peripheral retina. A large, whitish, fragile soft mass (myelin expulsion due to artifact) attached to the optic nerve head was noted in case E14. All the other 11 eyes (E1, E4-6, E9, E10, E12, E15, E16, E20, and E21) were grossly unremarkable.FigureÂ 1Histopathologic findings in postmortem eyes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

They include small neovascularization (FigureÂ 1E), retinal sclerotic vessels (FigureÂ 1F), retinal vascular occlusion (FigureÂ 1G) with fibrin/thrombi in retinal vessels (FigureÂ 1H), and vitreous hemorrhages. Eleven (E1, E4, E5, E7, E11, E13-15, E17, E18, and E21) of the 21 eyes (52.4%) contained cytoid bodies (the histopathologic constituent of clinical cotton-wool spots) in the nerve fiber layer of the neuroretina (FigureÂ 1, F, H and I) and/or on the optic nerve head (FigureÂ 1J). Focal loss of photoreceptor cells (FigureÂ 1, E, Iâ€“L) was noted in seven eyes (33.3%) (E6, E8, E11, E16, E17, E18, and E19). Fourteen eyes (66.7%) (E1, E2, E4, E6-8, E12 to 15, and E18 to 21) showed retinal/choroidal vascular dilation, congestion, and tortuosity (FigureÂ 1, Fâ€“H, J, and K). In addition, serous retinal edema in the inner and outer nuclear layers was noted in six eyes (28.6%, E3, E8, E12, E13, E17, and E19) (FigureÂ 1, D and K), whereas optic nerve head edema was seen in five eyes (23.8%) (E2, E4, E9, E13, and E21) (FigureÂ 1J). Fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer was also noted in two eyes (9.5%) (E8 and E11 in the macula) (FigureÂ 1K).Only one eye (E18) had viral inclusions, which stained negative for CMV, in a few retinal ganglion cells (FigureÂ 1L, inset). Except for one eye (E3) showing minimal to mild lymphocyte infiltration on the optic nerve and one eye with minimal choroidal monocytic inflammation (E16), no inflammatory cells were noted in the other ocular tissues or the other eyes. Importantly, cytoid bodies, retinal edema, or vascular congestions/hemorrhage were observed either alone or in combination in 20 of the 21 eyes (95.2%) and were associated with ddPCR positivity in the contralateral eye in 14 cases (Supplemental Table S2).Positive CD61 staining of platelet thrombi (FigureÂ 2), sometimes associated with fibrin and mononuclear cells, was observed in the retinal vascular wall in five eyes (E7, E13, E14, E17, and E18), all with positive ddPCR results in the contralateral eye and the presence of cytoid bodies in the nerve fiber layer of the retina. One eye (E18) also showed retinal vascular occlusion (FigureÂ 1G) and neovascularization (FigureÂ 1E). No CMV positivity was detected in any cases.FigureÂ 2Identification of platelet microthrombi with anti-CD61 immunostain.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected mostly in the outer nuclear layer (photoreceptor cells) of the retina in case E22 (FigureÂ 3A). Some SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detected in the inner nuclear layer and in the ganglion cells of the E22 retina. Examination of E23 demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within retinal inner and outer nuclear cells and a few ganglion cells (FigureÂ 3B). No signal was consistently observed using a standard negative control probe for the bacterial gene DapB to demonstrate specificity of the assay. As examples, images of retinal tissues (from E22 and E23) treated with the negative control probe are shown in FigureÂ 3, C and D, respectively. A focus of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the scleral fibroblasts of E24 (FigureÂ 4A). Additionally, analysis of E25 demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within oligodendrocytes of the optic nerve (FigureÂ 4B) as well as the retinal cells (FigureÂ 4C) and corneal epithelium (FigureÂ 4D).FigureÂ 3Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike RNA by in situ hybridization (ISH) in the retina.

The study described here is the first to demonstrate localization of SARS-CoV-2 to the ocular surface using ISH, supporting the RT-PCR-based findings from previous studies (FigureÂ 4, A and D).Non-CMV viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of active viral replication, were observed in only one eye (E18, with longer disease duration) within a few retinal ganglion cells (FigureÂ 1L). However, the contralateral eye from this patient was SARS-CoV-2 positive in the aqueous not retina by ddPCR. It is not uncommon to present discrepancies between the two eyes in ocular diseases, including infection. CMV retinitis tends to be unilateral in presentation.16Heinemann M.H.

The most common ocular histopathologic findings in the cohort were nerve fiber layer cytoid bodies; retinal vascular abnormalities, including dilation, congestion, tortuosity, and/or occlusion; and optic disc edema. These findings are consistent with microvascular insults in both early and late COVID-19 cases. However, all but one patient with cytoid bodies and retinal vascular dilation had concurrent cardiovascular risk factors, which might at least in part account for these findings. Clinical reports and autopsy studies indicate that multisystem microvascular injury and vasculopathy contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis, including in the central nervous system, where acute hypoxic injury, microinfarcts, microhemorrhages, and hemorrhages have been observed.18Deshmukh V.

In the study described herein, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the optic nerve oligodendrocytes in one eye (FigureÂ 4B). Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, antigenic mimicry and breakdown of the blood brain barrier have been postulated.28Assavapongpaiboon B. Apinyawasisuk S. Jariyakosol S.

Paul A. Krisgnagopal S. Kumar A. Acute bilateral retrobulbar optic neuritis - an atypical sequela of COVID-19.Indian J Ophthalmol. 2021; 69: 3761-3764Google Scholar Whether direct viral invasion can cause or potentiate these mechanisms is not known.As referenced above, this study has limitations. Given that ocular history and clinical examinations from the donors are not available, it is not known whether any of these observed changes preceded SARS-CoV-2 infection. The diverse comorbidities of the donor cohort can contribute to the observed ocular pathology; consequently, it is difficult to draw clear conclusions about whether the pathology was solely and/or mainly caused by COVID-19 or not. In particular, many of the donors in the study cohort had cardiovascular comorbidities, which could contribute risk factors for more severe COVID-19 and ocular pathology. Despite these limitations, the study shows important new insights into SARS-CoV-2 ocular pathogenesis. Specifically, this is the first report to definitively localize SARS-CoV-2 to the retinal inner and outer nuclear cells, retinal ganglion cells, and ocular surface by ISH, validating previous studies that have exclusively used PCR-based methods. These observations highlight the need to better elucidate mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistence in the eye, associated direct and indirect pathogenesis, and long-term ocular sequelae among COVID-19 survivors.AcknowledgmentsWe thank for their assistance the Histopathology Core Facility of National Eye Institute and the following NIH COVID-19 Autopsy Consortium members: Sydney R.
