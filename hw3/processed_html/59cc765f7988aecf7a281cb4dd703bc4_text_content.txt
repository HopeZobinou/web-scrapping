Early Access Game
Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.

What the developers have to say:

Why Early Access?
										“The game has completed its core gameplay and most of its content, and we believe it is now in a phase where player participation and feedback are needed to help us further improve the game experience. Early Access can help us collect more feedback, and involving players at this stage will make the game better.”

										Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
										“The Early Access status will last for approximately 12 months. This depends on the satisfaction of players with the existing gameplay and content of the game. We want to ensure that the game is released in a state that we are satisfied with.”

										How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
										“We have plans to improve the game in various ways, including more efficient performance, better graphics, better music&SFX, and additional language options. We're working to create richer game content, which may include more explorable areas, more diverse building modules, vehicles, and weapons, and modding options for players to create exciting new content.”

										What is the current state of the Early Access version?
										“At this stage, we have built a large world of 36 km² for players to survive, build, and explore. At the same time, the Early Access version also has good audiovisual effects and considerable content to meet basic gaming needs.”

										Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
										“Once the Early Access period is over, the price will go up due to the game's expanding content.”

										How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?
										“We listen to our community's feedback to improve the game and encourage players to join our social media channels (Discord, Twitter, FB, etc.). We engage with them to improve the game's quality. Furthermore, we aim to establish long-term partnerships with players, content creators, and communities that share our passion for the game, and together create an inclusive and enjoyable gaming experience for everyone.”

About This Game
							The Front takes place in a post-apocalyptic sandbox world populated by mutants and hostile factions. On this war-torn land, players will engage tyrannical imperial forces, exiles, thugs, and rebels in an epic battle that will determine the fate of humanity. Team up with your friends, explore ruins and enemy areas, craft weapons and equipment, build bases and defend them with tower defense-style traps, upgrade tech, pilot tanks and helicopters, battle the elements, and contend with fearsome foes!Sandbox-style ConstructionConstruct bases using hundreds of different building components to protect your resources and shelter yourself from this merciless world. The only limit is your imagination!Tower Defense-style TrapsStrategically route monsters through a brutal crucible of traps designed to slaughter explosive beasts, invisible assassins, flying soldiers, and other catastrophically powerful invaders.Craft Modern VehiclesCraft and pilot over 20 types of functional vehicles, including pickup trucks, logging trucks, mining trucks, self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, attack helicopters, and more. In the future, The Front will also feature modifiable base vehicles, allowing players to build mobile steel behemoths.Logical Systems and CircuitsUse monitoring devices such as pressure plates and infrared sensors along with complete circuits to construct automated defense systems.Raid Enemy Encampments and BasesArm yourself with a variety of melee weapons, firearms, explosives, and even tanks and helicopters, then use these tools of war to raid the bases of other players, or simply protect your own territory.Recruit FollowersUse Jammers to subdue NPCs you come across in the world. In addition to helping you in combat, these NPCs will also put their talents to use at workbenches to help you improve the efficiency of your operation and produce resources more quickly.Planting and CookingCraft water-powered equipment, then use it to develop your own agricultural system including spraying and planting. Choose from dozens of recipes to cook delicious meals.Explore a War-Torn WorldTrek across deserts, forests, snowlands, swamps, and more to find unexplored and treacherous areas such as underground research institutes and restricted military bases.
