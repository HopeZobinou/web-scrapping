How Mountains Were Made - The Lark - MediumMember-only storyHow Mountains Were MadeTo summit upStar Love Grey·FollowPublished inThe Lark·Oct 10--2ShareImage: Star Love Grey (AI Motionleap)Our fragile Earth has many faults, you see.Once all land was connected totally.Earth’s core bubbles and moves erratically.Change was inevitable undeniably.Awakened one day cataclysmically,plates separated and moved land out to sea.A first with many to follow with certainty.Now, a quiescent Earth now would never be.Crashing and colliding land moved up creatively,forming a new landscape quite majestically.Land so high, it touched the sky impossibly.New frontiers to discover and climb trepidatiously.Earth’s landscape is still shifting currently.Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are proof definitely.Without Everest and Kilimanjaro, what would we be?To make mountains was worth the growing pains, don’t you agree?Mountains are Earth’s undecaying monuments.— Nathaniel HawthorneThanks to Denise Larkin, BA (Hons), Editor of The Lark.
