 Didn’t work

We tried a few layouts, nothing worked like in the demo sites. Main photo didn't load, the navigation didn't work, captions were in strange fonts at the bottom of the thumbnails. Some layouts do not even have customization settings. Support was responsive but we do not have time to deactivate all plugins to solve the conflicts, we had other plugin worked perfect out of the box.

This plugin has a big weakness.
It is not possible to add a link to the image of each slide.

We request the programmer of this plugin to add and update this possibility.

 Best Carousel Plugin

This is the best carousel plugin that I can ask for. This is one such plugin that can handle images with different aspect ratios. This plugin fulfills all the slider needs for your website.
