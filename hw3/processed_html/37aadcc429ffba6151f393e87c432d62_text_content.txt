Her department's role was to explain Israel to the world and did not wield much power to begin with. Since the conflict began about a week ago, it has lost even more agency. She wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that it is now “a waste of public money". Translated from Hebrew to English she said: "This office cannot make a significant contribution to the country and the good of the country is more important to me than anything else."

But he warned actions leading to the failure of Gaza's only operational power station could "breach international humanitarian law". "To me, it amounts to collective punishment. Cutting off power, cutting off fuel supplies and water supplies, that's not the way a respectable democratic state should conduct itself," Varadkar said. He told Ireland's state broadcaster RTÉ: "Israel is a country that is surrounded by enemies, brutal savage groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, countries like Iran, often supported by Islamic fundamentalists and antisemites around the world."So Israel is under threat. They do have a right to defend themselves, but they don't have the right to breach international humanitarian law," he added.Varadkar also stressed the importance of opening of a humanitarian corridor to allow aid to reach Palestinians.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 22:05 12 Oct22:05 12 OctWHO says 11 medical workers killed in Gaza since SaturdayThe World Hearth Organisation (WHO) says it has documented 34 attacks targeting the provision of healthcare in Gaza since Israel's retaliatory strikes started last Saturday.

Lapid is the founder of the centrist Yesh Atid party, and is currently the leader of the official opposition in the Knesset. Alongside Netanyahu and Gantz, the new temporary cabinet includes Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.Netanyahu and Gantz said in a joint statement that a seat would be reserved for Lapid in the war cabinet.However, speaking on Thursday, Lapid said Netanyahu and Ben Gvir were "not the people who would restore
the shattered trust of the Israeli people in their government". Lapid added his party would not oppose the government and would support it during the security crisis.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 20:09 12 Oct20:09 12 OctWATCH: How Hamas pierced Israel's 'iron' defencesVideo contentVideo caption: Land, air and sea: Video analysis shows how Hamas coordinated huge attackLand, air and sea: Video analysis shows how Hamas coordinated huge attackThe BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera explains how hundreds of  Hamas militants managed to storm across the border between Gaza and Israel to carry out brutal attacks.

Soldiers now step through the shredded scattered belongings; the noise of shelling has replaced the music.Looking at the vehicles with their doors wrenched open, the scattered backpacks and bedding, it’s hard not imagine the panic as people tried to flee.The scale and brutality of this attack has shaken Israel’s sense of security. Since then, this site has been a closed military zone. Even the soldiers here are jumpy. 

While we were filming there today, gunshots suddenly cracked overhead and soldiers began running towards the perimeter fence. There were several minutes of panic and confusion, as soldiers ran to secure one location, then another, struggling to keep television cameras away. The army later said they had arrested one person near the site who they said had been armed with a knife.The young people here on Saturday morning trusted their army enough to dance and party a few miles from the Gaza border. Since then, everything has changed.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 19:29 12 Oct19:29 12 OctWATCH: US father's 'heartbreak' over son feared kidnappedVideo contentVideo caption: Father of hostage: 'Their welfare should be highest priority'Father of hostage: 'Their welfare should be highest priority'Jonathan Dekel-Chen's son Sagui - an American citizen - is missing and feared to be one of the 150 people being held hostage in Gaza.
