It's not something that is productive to speak about publicly, but we do it is something we're trying to achieve," Miller added.Pressure is mounting to establish a humanitarian corridor as Americans in Gaza who spoke with CNN have expressed fear and frustration about the situation, feeling they are trapped without any safe route out of the region that is being heavily bombarded by Israeli forces.They have told CNN that they do not feel the US government has been able to help them. There were reports that the only route out of Gaza — via Egypt — was closed Tuesday due to strikes and with the threat of an Israeli ground incursion looming. On Tuesday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the matter was "something also that we have been discussing with our counterparts in Israel and with our counterparts in Egypt.""And without getting into the specifics of safe passage for civilians and so forth, I will say it's something that the U.S. government is seized within supporting how we do that operationally," he said. Neither Sullivan nor Miller gave any timeline of when such a safe passage could be operational. Sullivan has spoken over the past several days with Abbas Kamel, the Egyptian spy chief, and officials expect President Joe Biden to speak at some point with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi."It is our top priority to protect the safety and security of Americans overseas," Miller said Wednesday. "I will also say, as the president said yesterday, we don't want to see civilian deaths anywhere. We want to see civilians protected. We want to see civilians not targeted. We expect Israel to follow the laws of war."share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link8:34 a.m. ET, October 11, 2023American death toll in Israel expected to rise, US State Department spokesperson saysFrom CNN's Jennifer Hansler The number of Americans killed in Israel is expected to rise, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told CNN Wednesday."Every day we get new information.

I do expect that, unfortunately, that the list of Americans who are confirmed dead will rise today," Miller said.The US continues to work to find the Americans who are unaccounted for, he added, noting that "it's a moving target all the time."US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that at least 14 Americans had been killed as a result of the Hamas attacks. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said "20 or more" Americans were unaccounted for as of Tuesday.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link8:28 a.m. ET, October 11, 2023Norway and Sweden organize flights for their citizens hoping to leave IsraelFrom CNN's James Frater and Sharon BraithwaiteNorway and Sweden are offering to fly their citizens out of Israel, as the conflict in the region threatens to escalate."Today we are setting up a Norwegian plane that can take Norwegians home to Norway.
