Keep warm and get help with heating
Keeping warm over the winter months can help to prevent colds, flu and more serious health problems such as heart attacks, strokes, pneumonia and depression.Heat your home to a temperature that's comfortable for you. If you can, this should be at least 18°C in the rooms that you regularly use, such as your living room and bedroom. This is particularly important if you have a health condition. It's best to keep your bedroom windows closed at night.Check your heating and cooking appliances are safe. Contact a Gas Safe registered engineer to make sure they're working properly.

Look in on vulnerable neighbours and relatives
Remember that other people, such as older neighbours, friends and family members, may need some extra help over the winter. There's a lot you can do to help people who need support.Icy pavements and roads can be very slippery, and cold weather can stop people from going out.Keep in touch with your friends, neighbours and family and ask if they need any practical help, or if they're feeling unwell.Make sure they're stocked up with enough food supplies for a few days, in case they cannot go out.If they do need to go out in the cold, encourage them to wear shoes with a good grip and a scarf around the mouth to protect them from cold air, and to reduce their risk of chest infections.Make sure they get any prescription medicines before the holiday period starts and if bad weather is forecast.If they need help over the holiday period when the GP surgery or pharmacy is closed or they're not sure what to do, go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.If you're worried about a relative or elderly neighbour, contact your local council or call the Age UK helpline on 0800 678 1602 (8am to 7pm every day). You can find your local council on GOV.UK.If you're concerned the person may have hypothermia, go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.
