It was very scary, and we were very worried,” Ricarda Louk said. “But now it gave us a little bit [of] hope that she's at least in the hospital, even if it's in a bad condition.”Ricarda Louk said she has sought support from the German government in helping free her daughter. “I don't understand really how such a brutal thing can just happen in the middle of the day and it was a complete surprise,” Ricarda Louk said.At least 260 bodies were found at the music festival site, according to Israeli rescue service Zaka. Some attendees were taken hostage, seen in social media videos being seized by their armed captors.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:06 p.m. ET, October 10, 2023At least 4 UN relief workers were killed in air strikes in GazaFrom Eyad Kourdi and Alex Stambaugh Officials with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said Tuesday four of its employees have died as a result of air strikes on Gaza. At least 14 of their facilities in Gaza have been damaged directly or indirectly, UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma told United Nations news. The agency has been unable to bring any aid into the Gaza Strip since Saturday, Touma said.The UNRWA hosts 170,000 people in more than 80 schools and other facilities throughout Gaza.

That is how she, as a mom, has pieced together where she now believes her son is.”  Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin now believe their son has been kidnapped by Hamas after attending a music festival.  Listen and follow Tug of War: Attack on Israel wherever you get your podcasts. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link10:34 p.m. ET, October 10, 2023Recent New Jersey high school graduate among those missing in Israel, governor saysFrom CNN’s Zenebou SyllaA recent New Jersey high school graduate serving as a soldier in the Israeli military is missing following Saturday's attacks on Israel by Hamas.New Jersey Gov.

He confirmed that among the hostages are Israelis, Americans and other nationalities. Herzog said he was not sure if any hostages had been killed. Discussing the evacuation of foreigners from Gaza, Herzog said they are coordinating with Egyptian and US authorities to assist in the safe exit of these individuals, given that the border with Israel is firmly shut.  “The border between Israel and Gaza is closed – this is a warzone,” Herzog said. “We are under no legal obligation to provide them with anything save for the basic humanitarian needs for sustenance. We comply with international law.” Israel remains compliant with international law.
