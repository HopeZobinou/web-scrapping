EUGENE, Ore. – Eugene police said there is no active threat to Shasta Middle School after investigating a threat made Tuesday morning.The school’s principal, Brady Cottle, sent out a note to parents Tuesday afternoon saying that a Shasta student posted they “were going to shoot up the school today.” Several students who saw the message told teachers and after police immediately investigated the threat it was determined there was no active threat to the school.Cottle said he is committed to proactively addressing and investigating any concerns raised by students and parents and said he is available to talk with any students who may be worried or concerned about their safety.“At Shasta, one of our best tools is our strong, caring relationships and partnerships with our students,” Cottle said in her note to students’ parents. “Students are encouraged to tell a trusted adult about any situation or information that is concerning to them. I am very proud of the students who came forward today with their concerns today. We take these issues seriously and investigate every concern as if it is a real threat.”Cottle also said the school is continuing to collaborate with Eugene police officials and will share any new information that becomes available.
