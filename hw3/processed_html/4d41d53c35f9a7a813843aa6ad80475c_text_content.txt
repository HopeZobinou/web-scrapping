To learn about how you can start submitting and voting on proposals, you can read our in-depth guide to the Lybra DAO.In today’s article, we’ll be reviewing how the Lybra Wars incentive dynamics unlocked by the DAO will drive increased value for LBR and esLBR holders whilst stimulating the growth of the wider Lybra ecosystem.Let’s start by recapping on what the Lybra Wars are before looking at the many benefits they offer for governance token holders and the Lybra protocol as a whole.What Are The Lybra Wars?As discussed in our previous article on the Lybra DAO, the move to a DAO governance structure empowers Lybra governance token holders to take control of key decisions on the protocol’s future. esLBR holders can now vote on matters related to any LST pool on the Lybra protocol, encompassing topics such as the acceptance of a specific LST asset, the mint limit of the chosen LST pool, and the emissions allocated to each LST pool. In fact, 3 potential LST partners are already preparing proposals to be accepted as collateral on Lybra in the coming week.This lays the groundwork for the Lybra Wars, as each LST pool can incentivize esLBR holders to cast their votes in the pool’s favor by bribing them with token rewards. The incentives that holders receive align with the amount of voting power they pledged in support.Here’s how this might work in practice, using the WBETH pool as an example:These bribing and incentive dynamics are known as the “Lybra Wars” as they motivate the different LST pools to battle for the votes of Lybra governance token holders. You can read more about how the Lybra Wars function in our previous article on the topic, but now let’s dive into how the different ways that they will drive increased value for esLBR and LBR holders …5 Ways The Lybra Wars Will Drive Value For esLBR & LBR Token Holders1. Receive Additional Yields Via Bribes From LST PoolsThe incentives that holders receive align with the amount of voting power they pledge in support of directing esLBR emissions to a given LST pool. The more esLBR you hold, the more voting power you have, and the more you can earn in bribes. Therefore, the bribes that holders receive from the Lybra Wars opens up an entirely new revenue stream, increasing yields.2. Increased Demand For LBR / esLBR From LST Projects Who Wish To Submit Proposals To Be Accepted As Collateral On LybraThe Lybra DAO will allow LST projects that are not yet accepted on Lybra to submit a proposal to the DAO to have their asset onboarded. Submitting a proposal requires holding a minimum of $10,000 of esLBR if it is an off-chain proposal and 100,000 esLBR if it is an on-chain proposal. This incentivises LST projects to buy up large quantities of Lybra governance tokens to submit their proposal. This in turn injects a major new source of demand for LBR / esLBR into the Lybra ecosystem, helping to support the value of the tokens.3. Reduced Availability Of LBR Due To Increased StakingTo have voting power and therefore to receive bribes from the Lybra Wars, LBR holders will need to stake their tokens, converting them into esLBR. This reduces the amount of unstaked LBR circulating on the market, providing further support to its value. Indeed, in the run-up to the Lybra DAO launch, the amount of holders staking their LBR as esLBR soared to over 40%.4. The Potential For A New Ecosystem Of Partner Protocols To Emerge That Capitalize On The Lybra Wars DynamicsOther protocols that have introduced similar incentive dynamics to the Lybra Wars have seen a proliferation of partner protocols emerge within their ecosystem. The new governance and bribing dynamics will allow for the creation of everything from Lybra governance aggregation protocols to incentive boosting layers, and more. Each of these can capture new audiences and bring fresh sources of demand into the Lybra ecosystem.5. A Decentralized Structure For LST Projects To Compete Against Each Other In Ways That Benefit Lybra Governance Token HoldersThe Lybra Wars dynamic allows the protocol itself to remain LST agnostic, whilst incentivising the LST projects themselves to find the optimal strategies for attracting volume. Each LST project will be motivated to reduce their own churn whilst increasing the churn of other LST tokens on the protocol. Different projects may even team up to gain wider influence. This opens up an exciting range of possible strategies for LST projects, each of which will benefit governance token holders by design, whilst the protocol itself maintains a neutral stance.In summary then, the Lybra Wars will increase the yields for esLBR holders, drive up demand for LBR/esLBR and reduce the supply of unstaked LBR. Together these factors will combine to provide significant support for the value of the tokens. It will also provide the framework for a dramatic broadening of the Lybra ecosystem that will help the protocol organically grow in terms of utility and adoption.Let the Lybra Wars commence!So, if you haven’t yet accumulated your esLBR position, now is a great time to get in on the ground floor as a beneficiary of the Lybra Wars. You can even buy your voting power at a discount by taking advantage of the new dLP and Vesting Penalty Bounties. Just head over to the “Bounty” section of the Lybra app, head over to the “Bounty” and claim your 40% discounted esLBR.In the meantime, you can keep in touch with us at:Twitter: https://twitter.com/LybraFinanceDiscord: https://discord.gg/mgyq3PhdJgWebsite: https://lybra.finance/Docs: https://docs.lybra.finance/lybra-finance-docs-v2DefiDecentralizationStable CoinLiquid StakingCrypto----FollowWritten by Lybra Finance253 FollowersBuilding the first interest-bearing stablecoin backed by LSD.FollowMore from Lybra FinanceLybra FinanceDAO PROPOSAL #1 【How To Handle V1 LBR that Missed the Migration Deadline】Background5 min read·Oct 3--Lybra FinanceHow To Migrate From Lybra V1 To Lybra V2 (With Screenshots!)4 min read·Aug 31--Lybra FinanceHow To Submit & Vote On Proposals In The Newly Launched Lybra DAOThe Lybra DAO is launching on Sunday 1st October at 1pm UTC.4 min read·Sep 27--Lybra FinanceHow The New Token Burn Mechanisms On Lybra V2 Are Applying Deflationary Pressure To Support The…Lybra V2 has built in several Token Burn mechanisms that permanently remove portions of the LBR supply from circulation on an ongoing…5 min read·Sep 26--1See all from Lybra FinanceRecommended from MediumLybra FinanceLybra x Pendle: A Case Study On How Partnering With Other Protocols Can Drive Mass Adoption Of eUSD…Introducing Lybra’s Partnership With Pendle5 min read·Oct 16--Owlto FinanceBridge-to-Win Lottery Event Teaser2 min read·Oct 9--ListsStaff Picks484 stories·375 savesStories to Help You Level-Up at Work19 stories·261 savesSelf-Improvement 10120 stories·765 savesProductivity 10120 stories·694 savesMagpieinRadpieIntroducing: esRDNTThanks to the accumulation of dLP from Radiant Capital, Radpie depositors have the opportunity to earn RDNT without the need to hold any…4 min read·Oct 12--Sovereign Crypto30–50X Altcoin PortfolioMy Altcoin portfolio and prospects for the coming Bull Run6 min read·May 19--12Messin' with Crypto'sinCoinmonksAltitude’s Ascent — Bluechip single-sided staking pools with no Impermanent LossKeeping in line with other articles I’ve written earlier this month about crypto bridges, today I’m going to be doing a deep dive into…5 min read·Oct 12--Levana Dragon RiderLiquid Staked Assets And Levana Leverage TradingThe Cosmos Ecosystem and the Struggle for DeFi Adoption: A New Dawn with Levana’s Liquid Staking Derivative3 min read·6 days ago--See more recommendationsHelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams
