Decentralized and Fair Betting 



At GuessOnChain, we’ve harnessed the power of Ethereum and the cost-effective Arbitrum blockchain to create a safe and transparent betting experience. It’s like having an open book where everyone can see the score – a place where fairness is a guarantee, not just a promise. 







 










Revenue Sharing 



At GuessOnChain, we believe in building a community driven platform. That’s why we’ve designed a system where part of our platform’s earning goes right back to our users. It’s our way of building a fairly incentivized community where we all grow together. 


















Deflationary 



GuessOnChain operates on a deflationary token model. A percentage of the revenue generated by the platform is used to market buy and burn $GUESS, gradually making the token scarcer and more valuable over time.
