Why Can’t you see it?. Untangling the Matrix  | by Mahesh Chookolingo | Oct, 2023 | MediumWhy Can’t you see it?Mahesh Chookolingo·Follow3 min read·Oct 11--ListenShareit’s crucial to recognize that our world operates as a complex system, much like the matrix in the movie with Neo and Morpheus. When we start seeing things for what they are, it provides us with a valuable perspective, enabling us to find genuine solutions and unveil the real puppeteers lurking in the shadows and underbelly of our planet.What makes this system truly formidable is the fact that much of the world’s darker forces hide behind the veneer of virtue, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) agendas, supposed environmental crusades, religions, economies, and politics. But once you start delving deeper, you’ll begin to see the true plays: the transactions, the motives, the deals, the movement of money, power plays, leverage, manipulations of global markets, and more.It’s convenient for people to believe that we exercise our voices when we cast our votes and that our collective voices matter. The truth, however, is that we’re all akin to sheep, cattle, with the real power players untouched. Every time we come close to exposing or calling them out, a major catastrophe conveniently occurs, shifting everyone’s attention to the distraction. The individuals who run the world understand the art of war, Machiavellian strategies, the real dealers and wheelers — those who wield true power. Meanwhile, we, the humble peasants, remain the cannon fodder, the pawns in a much larger chess game invisible to the commoners.I’ve decided that moving forward, I must ascend from the peasant class. Among the commoners, I’ve noticed a profound laziness in thinking, ambition, and a cry for things to be handed to them. The illusion they experience when they cast their vote blinds them to their true role as sheep who accept what they’re told. Sometimes, I feel that everyone deserves this state. After all, why else would we all permit this global play?I must rise beyond the commoners because, for those like me, it’s essential to be playing at the elite level or on the battlefield. I haven’t determined where or how yet, but I do understand that I need to transcend the peasant class. Let’s hope that my article stems from a place of spiritual frustration with the people of Earth. I amSomewhat being facetious and sarcastic but i don’t know how else to get you the reader to Think and Observe. To deel empowered. And that if we all work together in the unveiling we disarm all the leverage they have on us. And we will achieve the peace we all seek.#AwakenToReality #EliteOrPeasant #NavigateTheMatrix #RiseAbove— -Prepare yourself to navigate this complex, nuanced matrix-world with the following books:1) “Recapture the Rapture” by Jamie Wheal2) “Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius3) “The 48 Laws of Power” by Robert Greene4) “The Art of War” by Sun Tzu5) “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss6) “Behold a Pale Horse” by Milton William Cooper7) “The Field of Fight” by Lt.
