        Ali Jaafar (pictured left), 63, and Yousef Jaafar (pictured right), 29, were found guilty by a federal jury on Friday on several tax evasion and money laundering charges, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. Ali Jaafar was sentenced to five years in prison. Yousef Jaafar received a sentence of more than four years. They were also ordered to pay $6million in restitution and forfeit the profits from their scheme. Mohamed Jaafar (pictured center), another of Ali Jaafar´s sons who once interned for Democrat Senator John Kerry, pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme in November and got six months in prison.

      Queen Rania of Jordan (main) spoke with barely-concealed fury at Israel's shelling of Gaza, and called the Western world 'complicit'. Rania said that the Western world was 'giving Israel cover' and that the 75-year conflict was 'a fight for freedom and for justice'. She also denounced the 'glaring double standard', saying that there was a 'shocking' difference in the global response to the killing of Israelis by Hamas and the killing of Gazans by Israel. Right, victims of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, which Rania condemned as 'butchery'.

       Jesus Ayala, 18, and Jzamir Keys, 16, (top) were seen smirking, laughing and making obscene hand gestures as they faced court for the death of Andreas Probst, 64.  The retired police chief died after being struck (bottom) by a car while riding his bicycle down a highway, which police believe was intentionally done by Ayala and Keys in August. Taylor Probst (inset) said her father's accused killers flipped her and her mother off. Besides the fatal collision with Probst, which the two are said to have filmed, police also believe they had been involved earlier that day in another incident of a 72-year-old cyclist being mowed down.

                Lieutenant Colonel Or Ben Yehuda and her 12 women soldiers of the Caracal Battalion led the frontline fightback from armoured personnel carriers after racing to a military post on the Egyptian border that was being attacked during the Hamas onslaught. With rockets raining down all around her, she learned that the terrorists had broken through Israel's border fence with the Gaza Strip and were heading for the Jewish settlements of Shlomit and Bnei Netzer on October 7. In a pre-battle address, Lt-Col Ben Yehuda then told the 12-women unit that they were strong and would not be defeated. She said: 'We are going to eliminate terrorists. [An] Infiltration into Israel is happening and it's spreading. Stay alert. We might cross paths. We are a strong squad.' Over the next four hours the 12-women unit engaged in a bitter fire-fight with Hamas, who sent wave after wave of gunmen against them. Despite some of the soldiers getting wounded, the all-female unit continued to fight.

       The IDF said that at least two Hamas terrorists attempted to access Israel via the sea at Zikim - just north of the Gaza Strip - after entering a nearby beach in Gaza via a tunnel. Footage posted by the Israeli military shows a coupe of naval vessels seeking out the target. Large explosions can then be seen in the water with a small section of the marine craft poking above the water. The two Hamas fighters were killed in an attack by fighter jets and soldiers from Israel's navy, who also destroyed a weapons storage facility being 'used by the terrorists'.

                A group of students at George Washington University caused outrage resulting in calls for them to be expelled after the projected messages on to the school's library in support of Hamas ' barbaric assault on Israel. There have been calls for GWU president Ellen Granberg, pictured top left, to act on the student's actions. Messages that read 'Glory to our martyrs,' 'Divestment from Zionist genocide now' and 'Free Palestine from the river to the sea,' according to the activist group StopAntisemitism. This is just latest horrifying instance of student groups supporting terrorism across college campuses.

       Republican lawmakers booed, jeered and told a reporter to 'shut up' when she tried to ask Speaker nominee Mike Johnson about his vote in 2020 to overturn the presidential election results. During a large press conference on Tuesday, Rep. Johnson (R-La.) immediately shook his head and put on an amused smile as ABC News reporter Rachel Scott began her question. 'You help lead the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, do you-' Scott started to ask before being shut down by a large group of the Republican House conference.

                Bijou Phillips was seen looking strained on Tuesday, as she was pictured for the first time since her estranged husband Danny Masterson was expelled from Scientology and declared a 'suppressive person'.  The actress, 43, wore a light pink long-sleeve top and denim shorts, as she grabbed groceries from a store in Santa Ynez, California.  The former socialite kept it casual in a pair of grey Birkenstock sandals, and accessorized with a black shoulder bag.

                ​ Jimmy McCloskey ​ Gavin Newsom was granted a surprise audience with China's leader Xi Jinping when he visited Beijing on Wednesday after being warmly welcomed by other senior leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. It was a welcome that stood in sharp contrast to the official dialogue between Beijing and Washington in recent years. Relations between the world's two largest economies are currently at a low ebb over a host of issues including China's aggression toward Taiwan, its activities in the South China Sea, trade and human rights. Despite that, Newsom, the Democratic California governor, said his meeting with Xi had been 'remarkably positive'. Newsom has continued to deny whirlwind speculation that he could replace the ailing Joe Biden, 80, on the Democratic presidential ticket.

                Fraser Michael Bohm, 22, (left) was re-arrested Tuesday on four counts of murder in the deaths of Niamh Rolston, 20, Peyton Stewart, Asha Weir and Deslyn Williams, all 21, (pictured right). The four sorority sisters died at the scene when the BMW (insert) driven by Bohm - the night after his 22nd birthday - plowed into them as they stood by their cars close to a Pepperdine frat house off of the Pacific Coast Highway last week. Bohm was initially arrested after the crash and charged with gross vehicular manslaughter, but was 'subsequently released to allow detectives time to gather the evidence needed to secure the strongest criminal filing and conviction.' The sheriff's department is collecting evidence including toxicology, speed analysis, execution of search warrants, the police said in a press release .

                Instructing viewers from around the world to look at the blue and beige picture, @mia_yilin_ who regularly shares visual brainteasers on TikTok asked: 'What's the first thing you see in this picture?' One of the solutions indicates that you are scared of commitment, and that you' are also very prone to overthinking, causing unnecessary stress in your life'. However, if you spot the other image, it shows that you're a 'a highly empathetic person' who is 'quick to pick up on the emotions of others'.

Rebekah Pedersen, pictured right, told ABC Los Angeles in an interview that she was told that Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon's office was not willing to charge the suspect with felony attempted rape because the attack 'didn't say that's what he was going to do.' A witness described the attacker as 'salivating' prior to the attempted assault.

       A former McDonald's corporate chef has revealed the one essential cooking tool you'll never see in the fast-food chain's kitchen. Mike Haracz, who worked at the franchise until 2019, took to his TikTok account to share the surprising fact with his more than 207,000 followers. In his video, the Illinois-based chef answered a follower's question about whether or not employees had access to a knife - and revealed the answer to be 'no.' Mike explained that the utensil was simply not needed because all the food items arrived pre-cut.

                Fresh photos of Travis Kelce's new Kansas City mansion show that is fit for footballing and pop star royalty.  The tight end, 34, closed in on a deal last week to purchase a $6million mansion in a Kansas City neighborhood amid his blossoming romance with Taylor Swift, 33.  As his relationship with the pop sensation heats up, with Swift now having attended four of his games, the two-time Super Bowl winner reportedly felt he had to step up his game.  And new photos of his new pad show that it provides everything the NFL star desires and more.

                The late Kirstie Alley 's lavish Clearwater, Florida mansion has officially sold for $5.2 million - after being put on the marker earlier this year in February for $5.95 million. The Cheers actress notably passed away late last year in December 2022 following a secret battle with colon cancer at the age of 71. Her shock death was announced by her two children: son William, 31, and daughter Lillie, 29. The estate - which was confirmed to be sold by Realtor.com - notably has nine bedrooms, 10 bathrooms as well as a heated swimming pool in the spacious backyard.

                Barack Obama's Secret Service agent called 911 chef Tafari Campbell (left with the Obamas) fell off a paddle board on Martha's Vineyard (right). The agent reported that that there were already swimmers in the water trying to find the 'house guest' who'd fallen. Audio from two initial calls, shared Tuesday by the Dukes County Sheriff's Office, were heavily redacted, bleeping out names and other specifics about those involved and the property. The calls show early chaos as Secret Service, staff and others on site scrambled to get help after the Obamas' personal chef Campbell, 45, fell into the water.

                Lt Col Johnny Thompson, who is famed for appearing alongside the royals in a kilt, was 'due to leave the Army within 18 months', ending his role as an equerry, an insider has claimed. But he will soon be tasked with organising Charles' private affairs after being promoted from equerry to 'super equerry'. Thompson, 40, received his promotion after he reportedly charmed the King and Queen Camilla. Thompson, who lives in Surrey, first won over fans after he was spotted at Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, prompting royal watchers to brand him a 'hunk'. Since then, he had made further appearances, including attending the King's coronation.

       Two women who were set up as pen pals for a fifth grade school project at age 10 have finally met in person, more than 40 years later.  Haley Briggs, from Douglassville, Pennsylvania and Krystel Alston, from Ontario, California, continued to write to each other throughout their lives. After finally agreeing to meet to celebrate their 50th birthdays in 2020, the happy occasion was delayed due to the pandemic lockdowns.
