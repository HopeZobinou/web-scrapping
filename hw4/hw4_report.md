# Q1 Friendship Paradox on Facebook
Determine if the friendship paradox holds for a user's Facebook account.

*Q: What is the mean, standard deviation, and median of the number of friends that the user's friends have?*  

Create a graph of the number of friends (y-axis) and the friends themselves (x-axis), sorted by number of friends. The friends don't need to be labeled
on the x-axis: 1, 2, 3,..., n should be sufficient. Include the user in the graph in the appropriate sorted position (count the number of their friends) and label as *U*.

*Q: Does the friendship paradox hold for this user and their friends on Facebook?*
