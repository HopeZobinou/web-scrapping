# Q1. Color nodes based on final split

Draw the original Karate club graph (before the split) and color the nodes according to the factions they belong to (John A or Mr. Hi). This should look similar to the graph on slide 92 - all edges should be present, just indicate the nodes in the eventual split by color.

*Q: How many nodes (students) eventually go with John and how many with Mr. Hi?*
