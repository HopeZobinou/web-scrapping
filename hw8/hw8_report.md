# Q1
Generate a list of at least 50 popular accounts on Twitter. The accounts must be verified, have 10,000+ followers, and have 5000+ tweets.  For example:
* [`@acnwala`](https://twitter.com/acnwala) - is not verified, ~440 followers, ~3200 tweets - *don't include*
* [`@williamandmary`](https://twitter.com/williamandmary) - verified (blue checkmark), 35,000+ followers, 9,000+ tweets - *could include*  

Generate this information manually by visiting individual account pages. You only need at least 50 popular accounts.

Because we're trying to cluster the accounts based on the text in their tweets, you should choose several sets of accounts that are similar (political, tech, sports, etc.) to see if they'll get clustered together later.

Save the list of accounts (screen_names), one per line, in a text file named `accounts.txt` and upload to your GitHub repo.

*B: What topics/categories do the accounts belong to?  You don't need to specify a grouping for each account, but what general topics/categories will you expect to be revealed by the clustering? Provide a this list before generating your clusters*
